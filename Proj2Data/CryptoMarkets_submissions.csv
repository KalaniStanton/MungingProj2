PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE UPVOTE. Help 1000s of people. Missing 1000s of dollars. With support MIA for months.,"I just finished a scan of reddit and twitter, searching for Bittrex support issues. It's ridiculous to read about some clients of theirs who have been waiting 4+ months for a response, let alone a resolution. 

This just isn't right. They happily accepted our deposits to trade. That's an agreement that our issues should be dealt with in good faith, in a timely manner and with open communication. 

The backlog excuse, I've heard it many, many, many times before. That's not our problem. It's theirs. And whatever they have to do to resolve and lessen the backlog, do it. No more excuses.

Hire more staff. Change the resolution process. Increase shifts. Overtime. So many options. 

God doesn't need to tell us you're rolling in crypto right now. I'm sure the funds are there to implement whatever possible improvements are necessary and give people back their money.

Do you think support is this tough with the largest traditional stock brokerage sites? Or banks? Not even a chance. After a 10 minute call, issues are rectified. And that includes waiting on hold for five minutes. 

 This is from their twitter account on December 14, 2017...

""We have turned off user registration for a DB upgrade due to a large spike in new user sign ups.""

What about support upgrades? That's great about your new DB but seems like your tickets are only going to increase now by being able to handle more sign-ups. More congestion. More waiting. 

I currently have over $15,000 in support tickets with them. I know I'm not the only one. But if there is no fire under their ass, nothing will get done in a timely manner. 

POST YOUR ISSUES HERE AT REDDIT.COM/R/BITTREXSUPPORTLOGS. 

They are not listening on twitter anymore so here's another way for us to voice and let them know we won't tolerate the way they're handling OUR money. 

Subscribe. Post. Upvote other posts. Comment. That's the only way we'll get this rolling. 

And if you haven't had to file a support ticket, lucky you. I hope you'll never have to. But help us out anyway. ",228

I know hes a paid shill and I know they are all trash coins, I don't plan on holding any for more than a few minutes. I have absolutely nothing to do where I currently live so my plan is to leave his Twitter open while I play through Halo CE and borderlands 2. The moment he tweets some dribble and if it's on the exchange with my Bitcoin I'll buy immediately and sell after I'm happy with the profits. I'll compare to my main portfolio and see where it ends up.

Edit: after some math I realised I only need to make 39% profit on each trade to achieve this. Fun fact, using similar math and a well known calculation you only need 10 trades/cycles of 7.2% gains to double your money!

Edit 2: Added a name for this after lying in bed unable to sleep - The 7 days of Christmas challenge as it starts on Christmas day for me in Australia.

Edit 3: RIP inbox, away from home for Christmas so waking up on Christmas morning to so many comments albeit remind me in 1 week was pretty cool.

4: Day 1 was a failure, not on cryptopia like all the past ones. tried it with some money I had on bittrex but it truly seems bots have taken over and instantly cause connection issues when you go to that exchange pair....

Also thank you for the Reddit gold kind stranger, was a nice Christmas present :), this individual a long with 4 others have asked me to add a dogecoin address for future projects so I have. 

To be clear I am not asking for donations or money at all, anything donated will be stored and eventually donated to charity. If I actually get some donations to this address I'm thinking id run a poll for the community to vote to determine where the coins should be invested. After a year of hodling and perhaps several more polls to adjust the portfolio any money will be donated to charity. Again I have been asked to do this and replied to these people saying I don't want to look like I'm asking for money, I do however think this would be a cool idea to have a community run portfolio to give to needy causes.

So beginners are trying to fool other beginners.Now i decided to write down some basic advice to avoid mistakes.  

1) only play with money you can afford to lose.


2) NEVER EVER make a buy or sell that is triggered by a feeling of 'not wanting to miss out on a sudden development'. also known as fomo: fear of missing out. Invariably, you will make bad decisions if you do.


3) never buy on a sudden upswing. Especially if you don't know why it's swinging up. You may be buying into a hype curve triggered by other people's fomo. When that happens, you'll lose big in the correction that follows. The one exception is if you see a spike and then also find a good reason. When segwit was finally locked in for bitcoin, all the uncertainty ended and the price shot up for a very good reason. Jumping on that train can be a good decision.


4) when you finally take a profit and sell, walk away. Don't keep looking at the price. If you do and you see it going beyond the sell price, you may be tempted to jump in again and take a bit more profit. Not only do you pay 2 extra transaction fees, but you will also risk buying into an overshoot which corrects 2 minutes later, and you lose the profits you realized 5 minutes earlier.


5) understand that by playing carefully and with consideration, you may actually miss an occasional coin suddenly increasing in price. that is not to be helped. However, it also means that you are not making a lot of blind gambles that will cost you a lot of money.


6) do some research, and only buy into projects for which you actually understand the purpose and which you believe may work in real life. a coin needs more than fanboys shills to be valuable long term.


7) be very carefull when buying during a time period when there is a lot of euphoria and all coins are going strong. If the entire market is going strong, all coins do well, even the shitty ones


8) learn to recognize pump and dump cycles and avoid them. the saying in poker is: if you don't know who the sucker is, it's you. don't be the sucker.


9) look at the long term prices and use baselines, triangles and fibonaci and try to think of what you think the correct value to buy is. with some basic effort you can figure it out and set the buy order and walk away.


10) Do NOT try to play the game of buying and selling dips. buy dips if you want to play that game, but don't sell with the idea of buying back shortly after to game the dip. this is a good recipe for disaster. If you were holding NEO 2 days ago when it was 0.0039 BTC and sold with the idea of buying back at 0.0033, you'd be cursing yourself badly now that it shot up to 0.0064


11) when buying, don't just look at the timeline, also look at the order book. If you see big sell walls that are not balanced by buy walls, it may be better to wait for the price to drop some more.


12) doing the things above takes time and consideration. you will miss out from time to time by waiting to long, but you will also not make catastrophic errors. Also long as your positions are string, you can continue to keep playing the game.


Ok this was more than I had planned to write down, and nothing in it was rocket science, but it may help beginners. I surely did not start making decent profits until I started doing this.",115

Many people entered recently at a time when the market was rewarding the very worst type of investment behavior. Unfortunately there aren't many guides and a lot of people end up looking at things like Twitter or the trending Youtube crypto videos, which is dominated by ""How to make $1,00,000 by daytrading crypto"" and influencers like CryptoNick.

So I'll try to put together a guide from what I've learned and some tips, on how to invest in this asset class. This is going to be Part 1, in another post later I'll post a systematic approach to valuation and picking individual assets.

#Getting started: Tools and resources
---------------------------

You don't have to be a programmer or techie to invest in crypto, but you should first learn the basics of how it functions. I find that [this video by 3Blue1Brown is the best introduction to what a blockchain actually is and how it functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4), because it explains it clearly and simply with visuals while not dumbing it down too much.  If you want a more ELI5 version with cute cartoons, then [Upfolio](http://www.upfolio.com) has a nice beginner's intro to the blockchain concept and [quick descriptions of top 100 cryptocurrencies](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained). I also recommend simply going to Wikipedia and reading the blockchain and cryptocurrency page and clicking onto a few links in, read about POS vs POW...etc. Later on you'll need this information to understand why a specific use case may or may not benefit from a blockchain structure. Here is a [quick summary of the common terms](http://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/a-quick-guide-to-cryptocurrency-terms) you should know.

Next you should arm yourself with some informational resources. I compiled a convenient list of useful tools and sites that I've used and find to be worthy of bookmarking:

**Market information**

* http://coinmarketcal.com - Keeping tabs of everything going on in crypto is tough, wouldn't it be great if there was some sort of calendar? Well this is a calendar of upcoming crypto events, whether its conferences, product releases, burns, exchange listings...etc. You can also filter by types of events, coins and month. 

* http://coin.fyi - Great for following the news related to a specific cryptocurrencies

* http://cryptopanic.com - An aggregator of various crypto sites and news, filterable. 

* http://coinspectator.com - Another aggregator from over a 100 different sources of crypto news.

* https://www.ccowl.com/news - News from major sites (CoinDesk, Cointelegram, Bloomberg...etc) on one page 

* http://cci30.com - Kind of like the S&P500 for crypto, its an index of the 30 biggest cryptocurrencies

* http://eveningstar.io - this is basicall trying to be the Morning Star for cryptos

* http://icotracker.net - I like this site for looking at what ICO are coming up

* http://www.icoalert.com - Another good site for upcoming ICO tracking

* http://icodrops.com - More ICO listings and they have a ""hype"" rating 

* http://bitcointalk.org - Probably the biggest crypto community, lots of Bitcoin old timers who have seen it all

* Both [Medium](http://medium.com/topic/cryptocurrency) and [Steemit](http://steemit.com/trending/cryptocurrency) have plenty of blogs to follow depending on what interests you within crypto

* Telegram is the preferred chat platform, just stay away from PnD groups (same for Discord PnD groups)



**Analysis tools**


* http://cryptowat.ch - Great charting tool owned by Kraken that gives you a pretty wide look at various cryptos across most major exchanges.

* http://coinmonsta.io/metrics - Want to see what the most shilled coins are on Twitter? This ranking multiplies the number of tweets vs. sentiment estimate to arrive at a score.

* http://onchainfx.com - A better version of coin market cap, has all sort of columns and you can add flags. Also I like their market segmentation filters. 

* http://www.sifrdata.com/ - Great visualizations of various metrics. I find their correlations to be very useful.

* http://www.coingecko.com - includes useful information about crypto like the breakdown volume by fiat currency, social media stats, code repository stats..etc

* http://www.tradingview.com/chart/ - the best charting site that I use for stocks, however it has plenty of major cryptos

* http://www.iconomi.net/dashboard - basically forms different ETFs out of cryptos. Not a bad place to get ideas for your portfolio.

* http://cointrading.ninja/correlation - See a matrix of price movement correlatiosn between various cryptocurrencies over various periods.

* http://coinmarketcap.com - Useful for scanning the market, and finding the blockchain explorer and official website for each individual crypto. Their API is also quite useful for Excel based analysis.

* http://icobench.com - Another ICO tracker which does nice summaries, shows teams, milestones, financials and gives a rating for each IC

* http://cryptomaps.org - Visualization of price across different segments, primarily hashing functions and ICO release dates

* http://solume.io - compares the number of Twitter mention increase decrease to price

* http://www.badbitcoin.org - a list of all the known scam sites. Check this list before joining something.


**Portfolio Tracking**

* Delta and Blockfolio are the major mobile apps, I personally recommend Delta. 

* For desktop [I prefer to use a CoinMarketCap API Excel tracker](http://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m3nvy/ive_created_an_excel_crypto_portfolio_tracker/) that automatically draws live data from CoinMarketCap. Customize it to your own liking. There are also plenty of online tracking sites like AltPocket but I've never used them so can't recommend one.

**Youtube**


I generally don't follow much on Youtube because it's dominated by idiocy like Trevon James and CryptoNick, but there are some that I think are worthy of following:

* Crypto Investor - A background in finance gives Crypto Investor a much more nuanced approach, and he is very insightful in terms of investor behavioral psychology. Listening to his negativity and criticism of parabolic price action in a sea of lambo chasing is refreshing.

* CoinMastery - Carter Thomas takes on a rational mid-term to long term approach to investing in crypto, and has been a voice of reason many times.

* DataDash - He's more focused on trading, but I still like him for his news summaries and overall decent content.

* IvanOnTech - Brings a programmers perspective, goes through the Github and explains many programming issues with blockchains.



#Constructing a Investment Strategy
---------------------------

I can't stress enough how important it is to construct an actual investment strategy. Organize what your goals are, what your risk tolerance is and how you plan to construct a portfolio to achieve those goals rather than just chasing the flavor of the week.

Why? Because it will force you to slow down and make decisions based on rational thinking rather than emotion, and will also inevitably lead you to think long term.

#Setting ROI targets
---------------------------

Bluntly put, a lot of young investors who are in crypto have really unrealistic expectations about returns and risk.

A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 10% ROI in a month to be unexciting, even though that is roughly what they should be aiming for.

I see a ton of people now on this sub and on other sites making their decisions with the expectation to double their money every month. This has lead a worrying amount of newbies putting in way too much money way too quickly into anything on the front page of CoinMarketCap with a low dollar value per coin hoping that crypto get them out of their debt or a life of drudgery in a cubicle. And all in the next year or two!  

But its important to temper your hype about returns and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year. The only reason we saw so much upward price action is because of fiat monetary base expansion from people FOMO-ing in due to media coverage. People are hoping to ride the bubble and sell to a greater fool in a few months, it is classic Greater Fool Theory. That's it. Its not because we are seeing any mass increase in adoption or actual widespread utility with cryptocurrency. We passed the $1,000 psychological marker again for Bitcoin which we hadn't seen since right before the Mt.Gox disaster, and it just snowballed the positivity as headline after headline came out about the price growth. However those unexciting returns of 10% a month are not only the norm, but much more healthy for an alternative investment class. Here are the annual returns for Bitcoin for the last few years:

Year | BTC Return
------|-------
2017 | 1,300%
2016 | 120%
2015 | 35%
2014 | -60%
2013 | 5300%
2012 | 150 % 

Keep in mind that a 10% monthly increase when compounded equals a 313% annual return, or over 3x your money. That may not sound exciting to those who entered recently and saw their money go 20x in a month on something like Tron before it crashed back down, but that 3X annual return is better than Bitcoin's return every year except the year right before the last market meltdown and 2017. I have been saying for a while now that we are due for a major correction and every investor now should be planning for that possibility through proper allocation and setting return expectations that are reasonable.

**How to set a realistic ROI target**

How do I set my own personal return target? 

Basically I aim to achieve a portfolio return of roughly 385% annually (3.85X increase per year) or about 11.89% monthly return when compounded. How did I come up with that target? I base it on the average compounded annual growth return (CAGR) over the last 3 years on the entire market:

Year  | Total Crypto Market Cap 
-------|------
Jan 1, 2014:|  $10.73 billion 
Jan 1, 2017:  | $615 billion

>Compounded annual growth return (CAGR):  (615/10.73)^(1/3) = 385%

My personal strategy is to sell my portfolio every December then buy back into the market at around the beginning of February and I intend to hold on average for 3 years, so this works for me but you may choose to do it a different way for your own reasons. I think this is a good average to aim for as a general guideline because it includes both the good years (2017) and the bad (2014). Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio. If you want to try for a higher CAGR than about 385% then you will likely need to go into more highly speculative picks. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. 

As the recent January dip showed while the core cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum would dip an X percentage, the altcoins would often drop double or triple that amount. Its a very fragile market, and the type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was profitable in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a microcap shillcoin, having an attention span of a squirrel...etc) will lead to consequences. Just like they jumped on the crypto bandwagon without thinking about risk adjusted returns, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon will be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble, whether the blame is assigned to Wall Steet and Bitcoin futures or Asians or some government. 

Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case or utility will accept that they themselves and their own unreasonable expectations for returns were the reason for the gross mispricing of most cryptocurrencies.

#Risk Management
---------------------------

Quanitifying risk in crypto is surprisingly difficult because the historical returns aren't normally distributed, meaning that tools like Sharpe Ratio and other risk metrics can't really be used as intended. Instead you'll have to think of your own risk tolerance and qualitatively evaluate how risky each crypto is based on the team, the use case prospects, the amount of competition and the general market risk. 

You can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm) as ultimately everything is tied to how Bitcoin does, but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).

Rt = Rm +Ri

The market risk is something you cannot avoid, if some China FUD comes out about regulations on Bitcoin then your investment in solid altcoin picks will go down too along with Bitcoin. This (Rm) return is essentially what risk you undertake to have a market ROI of 385% I talked about above. What you can minimize though is the Ri, the aset specific risks with the team, the likelihood they will actually deliver, the likelihood that their solution will be adopted. Unfortunately there is no one way to do this, you simply have to take the time to research and form your own opinion on how risky it really is before allocating a certain percentage to it. Consider the individual risk of each crypto and start looking for red flags:

* guaranteed promises of large returns (protip: that's a Ponzi)

* float allocations that give way too much to the founder

* vague whitepapers

* vague timelines

* no clear use case

* Github with no useful code and sparse activity

* a team that is difficult to find information on or even worse anonymous

While all cryptocurrencies are a risky investments but generally you can break down cryptos into ""low"" risk core, medium risk speculative and high risk speculative

* Low Risk Core - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero. 

* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have at least some product and are reasonably established, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash, Ripple, NEO..etc. 

* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, low caps, shillcoins, ICOs...etc. Most cryptos are in this category, most of them will be essentially worthless in 5 years.

How much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. If you're a newbie who doesn't understand the tech and has no idea how to value assets, your risk tolerance should be lower than a programmer who understand the tech or a financial analyst who is experienced in valuation metrics. 

Right now the trio of BTC-ETH-LTC account for 55% of the market cap, so between 50-70% of your portfolio in low Risk Core for newbies is a great starting point. Then you can go down to 25-30% as you gain confidence and experience. But always try to keep about 1/3rd in safe core positions. Don't go all in on speculative picks.

**Core principles to minimize risk**

* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.

* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.

* Never chase a pump. Its simply too risky as its such an inefficient and unregulated market. If you continue to do it, most of your money losing decisions will be because you emotionally FOMO-ed into gambling on a symbol.

* Invest what you can afford to lose. Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.

* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.

* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. Keep about 1/3rd in low risk core holdings.

* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback.

* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing bubble mode. You will also sleep much more comfortably once you take out the equivalent of your principal.



#Portfolio Allocation
---------------------------------------------

Along with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:

* Core holdings - essentially the Low Risk Core segment

* Platform segment

* Privacy segment

* Finance/Bank settlement segment 

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment

* Promising/Innovative Tech segment 

This is merely what I use, but I'm sure you can think of your own. The key point I have is to try to invest your medium and high risk picks in a segment you understand well, and in which you can relatively accurately judge risk. If you don't understand anything about how banking works or SWIFT or international settlement layers, don't invest in Stellar. If you have no idea how a supply chain functions, avoid investing in VeChain (even if it's being shilled to death on Reddit at the moment just like XRB was last month). 

What's interesting is that often we see like-coin movement, for example when a coin from one segment pumps we will frequently see another similar coin in the same segment go up (think Stellar following after Ripple).

Consider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down.

You should set price targets for each of your holdings, which is a whole separate discussion I'll go in Part 2 of the guide.

#Summing it up
-------------------------------------

This was meant to get you think about what return targets you should set for your portfolio and how much risk you are willing to take and what strategies you can follow to mitigate that risk. 

Returns around 385% (average crypto market CAGR over the last 3 years) would be a good target to aim for while remaining realistic, you can tweak it a bit based on your own risk tolerance. What category of risk your individual crypto picks should be will be determined by how much more greed you have for above average market return. A portfolio of 50% core holdings, 30% medium risk in a sector you understand well and 20% in high risk speculative is probably what the average portfolio should look like, with newbies going more towards 70% core and only 5% high risk speculative. 

Just by thinking about these things you'll likely do better than most crypto investors, because most don't think about this stuff, to their own detriment.

Interested to see what other people's picks for 2018 are!

If you thought 2017 was a ripper year for crypto, I think you're in for a big surprise in 2018! I'm not a serious finanical investor nor a professional giving advice but I wanted to share a few projects I'm excited for moving into 2018. Please follow up on this post by doing your own research and I hope you come to some of the same conclusions I did.

I get quite a few people PMing me asking me to share how I decide to invest in a coin. I use a rather strict methodology to ensure I only invest in future-proof technologies. It also means the coins I invest in will be more likely to survive dips and bear markets.

**My methodology**

I think the most important rule is to not chase pump and dumps. Research every coin that you think has potential and make decisions from there. 

Personally I only invest in coins with:

 * Solid and usable technology

 * Clear future use-case

 * Transparent researchable team

 * Evidence of active GitHub or code or working product

 * Token has value within the project (inherently part of the ecosystem)

If a coin is missing one of these characteristics, it needs to be super strong in another field to make up for it.  Honestly the biggest gains I have made are the projects I researched thoroughly, believed in and then HODLed, even through all the dips.

**Core picks**

These are the projects I believe have proved themself worthy of the long hold. I liken them to bluechip shares, they will hold (relative) value through dips but still have the potential to increase exponentially with adoption.

 * **[Raiblocks](http://wcibtc.com/xrb)** - Rai does one thing, and one thing well: fast and free transactions. It is honestly the perfect currency. The only know issue currently is potential spam attacks but the devs say they are working on this. It currently lacks data storage and smart contract functionality, but that can all be added later through different layer solutions. Really excited for this one!

 * **[IOTA](http://wcibtc.com/iota)** - DAG based data-network build for machine to machine transactions where you complete proof of work for 2 other transactions before yours is processed. People also seem to forget that IOTA software is only half of the picture; The IOTA devs have been working on processor hardware that can complete proof of work at a machine level. Expect big things of IOTA in the next few months as they ramp up annoucements.

 * **[Monero](http://wcibtc.com/xmr)** - The best privacy coin. As long as everyone is able to see all your transaction and wallet history, crypto will never be suitable for real-world adoption. Monero is tackling this problem head on.

 * **[Factom](http://wcibtc.com/factom)** - A token which builds off other blockchains to store financial contracts and data. Multiple grants from Dept of Homeland Security and Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. Working with Linxens (one of the largest RFID and passport manufacturers in the world) on Smart Identity products. They already have multiple Fortune 100 customers that will be annouced in Q1 2018 who are already implementing their products.

 * **[OmiseGo](http://wcibtc.com/omg)** - Finance and payment provider. Once they launch their own blockchain in 2018, all their current transactions will be routed through it with portions of the dividends being paid to OMG holders.

 * **[Binance Coin](http://wcibtc.com/binance-coin)** - Binance is now the number one altcoin exchange in the world. Their token is used to lower fees and they have been burning them to lower supply. With a limited number of tokens and the exchange traffic increases, the price of BNB tokens will be a good litmus test of the crypto environment.

 * **[Request Network](http://wcibtc.com/req)** - Full suite of auditing, finance and payment software powered by the blockchain. They launched their testnet on the Rinkeby Ethereum testnetwork the other week and it is absolutely fantastic. It will eventually expand to include other cryptos and fiat. One of my most exciting and promising holds.

 * **[Neo](http://wcibtc.com/neo)** - Smart contract and do-it-all platform. Often refered to as chinese ethereum with good reason. NEO has a huge developer community and HongFei has tweeted recently about being in talks with the Chinese government to provide a standardised platform to stick to their regulations. Perfect vehicle for Chinese capital to flow into the crypto ecosystem.

 * **[Stellar](http://wcibtc.com/xlm)** - Partnership with IBM speaks more then I can shill. A solid project

 * **[Ethereum](http://wcibtc.com/ethereum)** - Ever taken a glance over the top 300ish coins and realised how many of them are ERC20 Ethereum based tokens?Ethereum will flourish in 2018 as more DApps are released. Can't go wrong with Ethereum

**Volatile picks**

While I wouldn't consider these picks risky by my methodology, they lack the long term credibility and are probably more prone to volatile behaviour. Higher volatility means higher potential gains, but higher chance of loss.

 * **[UTrust](http://wcibtc.com/utrust)** - Payment platform system with the world's first inbuilt cryptocurrency consumer protections. If you missed REQ, now is your time to get in at the ground floor. Huge team and looks very solid.

 * **[Chainlink](http://wcibtc.com/chainlink)** - Decentralized oracles for linking real world applications with blockchain applications. I know 4chan has shilled Chainlink to death but if they can deliver what they promise it will be a top 20 coin.  

 * **[Quantstamp](http://wcibtc.com/quantstamp)** - Smart Contract auditing. Token holders also receive a free airdrop of every smart contract they audit. Backed by Ycomb. Ready to pop!

 * **[Bounty0x](http://wcibtc.com/bounty0x)** -A decentralized bounty hunting platform enabling anyone to manage bounty programs, and bounty hunters to receive payment for completing bounty tasks. Already have a working product and have gained some notoriety for hunting down the EtherDelta hacker. Solid concept and very low marketcap currently.

 * **[Horizon State Decision Token](http://wcibtc.com/decision-token)** - Australian startup focusing on providing a immutable polling and election results. One of the best uses of blockchain technology I have ever seen. They already have their product integrated in MiVote and are launching fully next year.

 * **[Eidoo](http://wcibtc.com/eidoo)** - A managed wallet with identity addons. Fantastic team and very professional looking. 

 * **[Modum](http://wcibtc.com/modum)** - Real time tracking for (legal) drugs in Europe. Credible team and has a working product. A solid pick that will see more attention as it's real-world roll-out starts

Happy new year 2018!",324

Eventually I got impatient of waiting for a reply, I went ahead and submitted a complaint on the BBB website, but that was to no help.

I'm here to ask each and everyone of you for help, I need this to go viral, please. I want everyone to know how Poloniex treats customers who invest money on their website, and that they shouldn't be trusted, this issue has been going on for more than 5 months now, and with such an amount it's very, very wrong to ignore me and freeze my account, no organization should do that.

I've trusted Poloniex with my money and this is what I get in return, a frozen account and no explanation of why my funds are held. This is very unprofessional and they're bad for the crypto community. Everyone needs to know about this and stop exchanging on this shady exchange.

Advice for any new traders","This is a comment I made in another post, and I would like to share for anyone who's interested in refining their strategy with Crypto trading.

After 1+ years of trading crypto, I've learned a lot about investing and trading. I started like many of us have--going with whatever was being shilled or mooning. Of course, I lost a LOT of money that way, and slowly my investment strategy has developed. I've learned a few key things. I sleep soundly at night, and rarely check prices/news because of the strategy.

1. The number one thing I'm looking for is a technology with an actual, practical use in the future. I just saw a post about ""OilCoin""--supposedly it will be a coin that will be SEC-compliant and match the price of a barrel of oil. WHO CARES? There is almost no point to that coin, except that it might be stable, and it has team members that worked for the government. This leads to my next criteria...

2. A good *business-savvy* team. I don't care if you have the top software engineer from Stanford and a 20-year Wall Street veteran. In fact, seeing people from Wall Street on the team gives me automatic thoughts of a pnd scheme run by someone who knows how to pnd. I want someone leading the business that has a long past of successful sales and business partnership experience--and not a ""serial entrepreneur"" either. I'm talking about someone who has closed deals, brought products to market, and made a company or two better than they ever were or ever have been.

3. A tech that, if it doesn't bring something completely new and useful to the table (such as ETH smart contracts vs. Bitcoin's value transfer way back when, or IOTA with DAG vs. all blockchain coins recently), completely blows its competition out of the water. For example, RaiBlocks is the hot new value-transfer crypto (competition to Bitcoin, many others) that completely puts blockchain-based techs to shame due to its use of DAG. With almost-free transactions, instant transactions, and potential quantum-attack immunity, there's no way to view it as a no-brainer right now. That's just an example of this criteria of mine.

4. My final criteria is a history of stability, and current wide adoption of the tech--even if I think it may have flaws down the road. These are the ""safe bets"" such as LTC and XRP that you can generally assume will slowly rise in value, and not crash/be manipulated by pnd's any time soon.

5. When I follow the above 4 criteria, this final point is the most important--I never panic when there is a dip. I know from my time trading that the great techs with great teams and great potential will always end up rising in value over the long-haul, and I don't need to worry about, ""Will it crash? Should I chase a shitcoin for short-term gains?"" (Which, I've learned, is the best way to lose a lot of money). 

Everyone has different strategies, and I firmly believe the only way to feel comfortable and not panic trade during dips and moons is to learn your own strategy the hard way, and learn from your losses. Good luck! ",196

I'm fine. HODL is a community problem. If you can't think for yourself, you deserve to lose. I expect downvotes, but is there no one that thinks this is insane? Don't let the Internet tell you how to manage your risks/assets.","Posted this on a FB group last Friday. I'm going to offer an opinion that differs from the HODL. That's not to say I'm not going to buy back in, but it's hard to take away from Reddit's bubbled crypto subreddits, whereas ""everyone"" has the same hive mind mentality. Here's one that's not. Anyways.

I sold out. =\, Today's movement (+) I don't think is sustainable. I think everything is at systemic risk right now. Unlike before, this is a global sell off, and not just a concentrated one (coupled with next weeks stock action).

People understand Mt Gox happened. There is billions tied to this market, so that is also going to put a stop on buys for awhile.

The hype is dying down. People aren't getting crazy moon gains, so less people are wanting in, collectively. People are getting burned by the crazy price swings - so all the grandmas, aunts and uncles who got in Dec, sorry for your loss. There was a ton of ignorance from people that came in from Dec as well.

Further, there is a systemic risk, and it starts and stops with the exchanges. I know I keep touting this horn, but I think Bitfinex sort of fucked this entire market with monopoly money.

I don't see the market immediately recovering. A modest bump, but then back down again. At best I see Eth getting to and staying sideways $1300 for a month. At worst, $450-500. It really depends on how people treat this market, and what the hell the SEC is going to do with Tether. This is going to be a long played out process. I could be wrong, so I will stay humble.

Psychology has alot to do with it, and with each passing day - people find out more and more about this market.

Edit - I was forntunate to begin making the vast majority of my sales Dec31-Jan14, before everything went kaboom. I still have about 30 in the market. In VEN. Just incase anyone is wondering. **I don't want to see people burned, just because they took Internet advice from a collective group of strangers.**

Edit 2 - **I've seen this hive mind mentality before with Wall Street Bets, /WSB/ and AMD stock. Moon moon moon. No, it didn't go to the moon.** It crashed, and its just gone sideways ever since everyone jumped on it via Reddit - and said 'hodl'. From $15.50 to $9.00. In that time, Intel (and nVidia*) has outperformed AMD's stock. Lisa Su memes, everywhere. That is this, all over again.

Edit 3 - **Even the top post in this subreddit, is Leonardo DiCaprio saying he aint going the fuck anywhere. XD. Its the top post. Do you know from that meme, how many people are actually going to subconsciously follow that advice? It's sad.** If Facebook interferred in our election, Reddit is a transference of that same viral-attitude to get quick rich scheme.

Edit 4 - While we like to stick to Crypto, just be aware of what's happening in the broader markets as well.  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buckle-up-this-ultimate-bear-chart-signals-a-pivotal-moment-for-investors-2018-02-05

I did find this quote to be cynical, funny (unforntunately relevent) at the same time.

**Update:** Thank you for your appreciation on this article. I decided to publish it on Medium. &nbsp;

[You can find the article on this link.](https://medium.com/@ross.p/with-less-than-a-dozen-days-left-before-the-segwit2x-fork-i-thought-id-start-gathering-some-facts-6386fe28d84f)

&nbsp;



**Existing Article:**

With less than a dozen days left before the SegWit2X fork, I thought I'd start gathering some facts before I start forming personal opinions and speculative conclusions. I refer to the SegWit1X chain as 1X and the SegWit2X chain as 2X for simplicity, and I have looked for very simple facts and safe assumptions. Here are the dots that I gathered: &nbsp; 


&nbsp;





• Fork at Block **494,784**. Approximate time = **16th of November** - see Reference 6 for exact time. &nbsp;


&nbsp;




• **The New York Agreement:** The NYA involved parties representing about 83% of the then hashing power who all agreed to both hardforks - one for SegWit and another for an increased block size of 2MB (2X) within 6 months of the former. Further details in reference 1. &nbsp;


&nbsp;




• It is safe to assume that miners will only mine the most profitable chain (possibly several chains in differing proportions). &nbsp;

• If whales pump a single chain it will gain more value. If this happens, miners will be more inclined to mine that particular chain only. This will result in the other chain(s)potentially losing overall mining attractiveness. &nbsp;


&nbsp;




• **1X** will continue to have a 1MB block and SegWit; &nbsp;

• **2X** will have a 2MB block and SegWit; &nbsp;

• **Bitcoin Cash** (Just for info right now) currently has an 8 MB block with NO SegWit; &nbsp;


&nbsp;





• **Current Price Status (Futures) on BitFinex:** 2X/BTC = 0.17; 1X/BTC = 0.83 &nbsp;


&nbsp;




• **Current Mining Status:** 2X = Around 85% of blocks are signalling for 2X. &nbsp;

It seems only a few mining pools including Slush Pool, F2Pool and Kano CKPool are not signalling Segwit2X. All Antpool (Jihan Wu) owned pools are signalling for Segwit2X and will likely continue to do so up to the fork. It is not clear if any other pools from the Segwit2X signalling group will change their minds in the meantime. &nbsp;


&nbsp;




• **Lower mining power chain:** Likely to be 1X. Fees likely to be extremely high as not many miners. Difficulty adjustment could take a few weeks, if not months. Until then it will be very difficult to transfer funds. [It may be better to keep BTC on an exchange before fork, to ease liquidity cost/time if you want to sell either of the coins immediately] &nbsp;


&nbsp;



• **Double-spending:** Miners (from 2X) will have an ability and incentive to double-spend on the minority chain (lower mining power chain). If you have huge mining power, you can allocate some of it to just double-spend on the minority chain. Some people will possibly lose confidence in the minority chain as a result. &nbsp;



&nbsp;



• **Replay-Protection:** Neither 1X nor 2X currently have replay protection. &nbsp;


&nbsp;




• **Exchanges:**

1. Bitfinex: original chain is “BTC”, SegWit2x chain is “B2X” &nbsp;

2. BitMEX: Original chain is BTC &nbsp;

3. Bitstamp: Unknown &nbsp;

4. GDAX & Coinbase: hash power and market cap decides which chain is “BTC” &nbsp;

5. Kraken: Unknown &nbsp;

6. HitBTC: original chain is “BTC”, SegWit2x chain is “B2X” &nbsp;

7. CoinsBank: Original chain is BTC &nbsp;

8. CEX.IO: original chain is “BTC”, SegWit2x chain is “B2X” &nbsp;

9. Gemini: hash power decides which chain is “BTC” &nbsp;

10. Coinfloor: Unknown &nbsp;

11. BTCC (Updated on Twitter): BTCC will consider which of 1MB and 2MB to name as #bitcoin based on market feedback and adoption. &nbsp;


Further details in reference 4. &nbsp;


&nbsp;





**The OPINIONs section**



• **Vinny Lingham's opinion:** 2X will outcompete 1X.  &nbsp;


&nbsp;




• **Enter Bitcoin Cash:** A review by Ryan X. Charles who has incorporated some of Vinny Lingham's quotes, states the following: &nbsp;


&nbsp;




	
**a.** BCH is a fork of BTC with same PoW, but with improved Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA). BCH cannot die, but 1X and 2X could both die. If whales shift most of their holdings to BCH (or another coin), that would incentivise the miners to mine BCH (or another coin) instead of 1X and 2X. Both 1X and 2X would lose their mining power; however Core would release an emergency update to software adding DAA like BCH (or another coin). Thus, 1X would survive, and 2X (which might not get DAA) would die. &nbsp;


&nbsp;





**b.** If 2X continues to be the dominantly mined chain, 1X will be forced to launch an emergency update to their PoW with DAA. There could be fighting between the two chains, and as a result a struggle to become dominant --> potentially causing altcoins to flourish. &nbsp;



&nbsp;


**My observations**

• **BCH** is upgrading their EDA (Emergency Difficulty Adjuster) on Nov 13. [See website](https://www.bitcoincash.org). This will lead to reduced volatility in BCH - likely making it more attractive to more long-term miners. &nbsp;


&nbsp;



	
• **Mining profitability:** It is currently almost equally profitable to mine either BTC or BCH. &nbsp;


&nbsp;





•  What to keep and eye on before the fork to judge yourself where the fate of BTC is heading. &nbsp;

1. **Mining** signalling distribution


2. **DAA**: 1X or 2X software updates to implement Difficulty Adjustment Algorithms


3. **Futures** price before fork


4. Significant **whale** movement

Hey everyone! I have recently decided to get as direct to the sources from what I have been seeing and hearing in the news regarding crypto. Recently I Interviewed Tyler Lindholm, a State Representative from Wyoming. He had a large part in constructing the crypto bills that were passed just recently. They are the first in the world to do this and it may have a huge impact.

6:00- We start to talk about the Bills.

10:20- Set up file 111. This is very interesting.

12:00- Virtual currency defined as a legal currency in Wyoming.

If you are lucky enough, few of you will have some profits, but these are only bread crumbs comparing with how much money the ""experts"" are making. 
Please understand that, it is possible to get rich with cryptocurrency but not over night. Read, form your own opinion over a crypto, think if that project has any potential and buy it. Don't wait for someone else to do it for you or to tell you what, when and where to buy.

• ""OMG guys buy into X super undervalued, low market.

• ""Guys WTF coin X is dropping fucking HODL.""


• Shitty Lambo memes.


• ""I'm out guys thanks for the roller coaster I've made 5000000000 dollars on X, Y, and Z.""


Isn't this sub supposed to be about the technology and talking about, I don't know, the actually fucking markets? I understand that alot of noobs are jumping on the crypto hype but please keep your shitty memes to yourselves we don't have many subs this big about coins as a whole w/o censorship. 


Mods please freaking mod ok. I've your having trouble controlling it all maybe open up some mod applications. At the very least raise the posting/commenting age and karma requirements.


^sorry ^I'm ^naturally ^salty ^as ^fuck.


Edit: I'd like to thank the mods for reaching out and taking all of our feedback.

A couple more things and rule proposals.

• Stop spamming your referral codes this isn't the place and no one is going to use it.

• Cut it out with the low effort posts one one wants to rate your portfolio no one cares.

• No more shit ICO's you know what mean the ones that are obviously spam

• No more clickbaity BuzzFeed like shit. ""Top 10 coins of 2017""

I've talked to a mod and hopefully they are planning on implementing some new rules and allowing the community to vote on them as this sub continues to grow.

This is not only due to their lack of understanding of the crypto scene but as well as a lack of relevant resources to help them identify pump and dumps to avoid them and/or take advantage of them. To help prevent that we are building a pump and dump watchlist to highlight potential pump and dumps. 

For a start we are using trading volume surge as a key indicator of possible pump and dumps. The logic is that a sudden trading volume surge can only be justified either by a very big news or a pump-and-dump. This list can serve as a trigger point, and you can easily jump on twitter and verify if there were any news justifying the exponential trading volume.

Here is how we are currently identifying PnDs: we identify the cryptos with average daily volume between $100k and $2M, and 24h volume at least 5x above their average daily volume. 

You can see this list in our beta tool here https://beta.digitalassetdb.com. We have a section on the page called Exponential volume surge. 

Please have a look and share your feedbacks in the comments. 

What do you think of this approach? 
Would you add other selection criteria to make this list more accurate?
What value do you see in maintaining a pump and dump watchlist since the crypto space is extremely volatile anyways?

*** 

**Edit 1:** We now show all assets with an average daily volume above $100K and 24h volume at least 5x above their average daily volume. 

**Edit 2:** Reports are now generated every 5 minutes.

**Edit 3:** Added Exponential Surge by Price

**Edit 4:** We have made lot of new update over the past few days. We posted about it in the part 2 of this post [here](https://redd.it/7m0sc7) let us know what you think.

**Edit 5:** Exponential Spikes are now based on weekly average price and volume instead of monthly previously.",174

Ok, so after reading and hearing about this digital money thingy that magically grows on its own making everyone rich overnight called Bitcoin and confirming you don’t have to buy a full coin for like $16,000, you’ve decided you want in. You setup your Coinbase account, gave almost all your personal and banking info, plus a photo, your ID and  your credit card to a complete stranger and bought a fraction of something you barely understand hoping it will somehow turn your hard earned money into a fortune someday. But it looks like you’re going nowhere, because as incredibly fast as BTC grows, right now it would need to go from around $16,000 to $32,000 just to turn your $300 investment into $600 and that’s far from the huge profits you thought you’d be making in a few months.

So... you read there’s this other thing called Alternative Crypto Coins or Altcoins for short, and people say many of them are incredibly undervalued, meaning that they haven’t been pumped in price yet so these Altcoins are the key to making it big for small investors like yourself. What happens when you decide you want to invest in Altcoins? Well, the main problem is that there’re more than 900 different projects out there and at least 100 of them can be considered somewhat “serious”. Then, how to decide which ones are worth your money?? Well, the main advice people gave newbies mere months ago was to read a lot, understand each project, visit forums, read whitepapers, check market caps, coins in circulation,join communities and decide for yourself.

And you may think: “I came here for the easy magic internet money and now I have to spend weeks reading things I don’t understand to decide if I should invest on a project that may or may not explode in price months or maybe even years from now?? No thanks. There has to be an easier way”.

And you decide it’s best to just check a few subreddits like this one and see what people are talking about. Ignoring all previous posts making exactly the same question you start a new thread asking everyone where you should put your money. And I don’t blame you. I’ve been there too. I know what it feels like to have your money ready to invest in anything and you just need someone to point you in the right direction, no matter which one, but fast because people are making money out of this and you don’t want to be left behind. So let me be the first one to say: OK. Go ahead and trust your money to a complete stranger on the Internet who’s telling you to buy as much as you can of this coin you’ve never heard of, but it’s going to the moon in a matter of days. It’s ok. You have to learn how this market works one way or another. Maybe after making your first few investments you can take it more slowly and start actually reading about this amazing new technological environment that’s the blockchain. Maybe after that you can make better personal decisions and even put your money behind a project you really find interesting and worth it.

I’m just going to give you one little piece of advice. When you’re reading posts and this guy comes and says “You should be all buying this coin because it’s got a great team behind, a serious project a real world application...” and all that, please, take your time to, at least, check that user’s history and profile. It will only take something from minutes to like an hour max and you’ll find out how long they’ve been redditors for, what other people think about them and their comments and posts, if they normally give good advice, if they’ve been right before about other coins, if they’re normally upvoted and therefore have a high karma... After all it’s your money and you shouldn’t just give it away without having at least a basic idea about where it’s going or if you’re just being used by some guy who just wants to dump his bags of shitcoins on gullible newbies.

Happy Hodling!!",49

Note: These are not weighted averages but I doubt that makes any difference.

[Top 100 CMC coins by price](https://i.imgur.com/rjW9rTl.png)  
Here we're sorting by price-per-coin from the most expensive coins (BTC, BCH, DASH, ETH) to the least expensive (KIN, XP, BCN, DOGE). There's a pretty clear trend here that the expensive coins are up a little bit, but the cheaper the coin is the more likely it is to be up a huge amount.

[Top 100 CMC coins by circulating supply](https://i.imgur.com/aha3LX3.png)  
This is sorted by the total number of coins in circulating supply, from fewest (GBYTE, GNO, BTCD, DGD) to the most (KIN, XP, BCN, DOGE). There's an even clearer trend here that the coins with smaller total supplies are up a little bit, but the more coins circulating the more likely that coin is to be up by a lot.

[Top 100 CMC coins by market cap](https://i.imgur.com/PXMjTeM.png)  
This is the top 100 coins by the value of their total market capitalization from lowest (WTC, POE, BLOCK, ITC) to highest (BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH). This time there's basically no trend. The coins with the highest market caps are up just about as much as the lowest market cap coins, and it's fairly random inbetween.

I'm neither a statistician nor a market analyst but this looks like pure market irrationality to me. The best recent predictor here for market performance of a coin is simply the size of its circulating supply, which is essentially a meaningless decision about where to put a decimal place. Satoshi could have just as easily capped bitcoin at 21 billion coins instead of 21 million, and maybe if he did the BTC market cap would be much higher because people would perceive it as ""seeming cheap"".

We're in a bull market and nearly everything has been up, so there's a lot of FOMO and throwing money at anything that moves. If this was the stock market I would knowingly tap the side of my monocle and say ""Oh ho, fundamental valuations will catch up to you in the end, and then you'll be sorry you didn't do your due dilligence."" In crypto, however, I've seen little evidence so far that fundamental valuation ever catches up to anybody.

An analysis.,"I am putting together my investment portfolio for 2018 and made a complete summary of the current Top 100. Interestingly, I noticed that all coins can be categorized into 12 markets. Which markets do you think will play the biggest role in the coming year?

Here is a complete overview of all coins in an excel sheet including name, a full description, market, TPS, risk profile, time since launch (negative numbers mean that they are launching that many months in the future) and market cap. You can also sort by all of these fields of course. Coins written in bold are the strongest contenders within their market either due to having the best technology or having a small market cap and still excellent technology and potential. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8PHcNvvjuy848q18py_CGcu8elRGQAUIf86EYh4QZo/edit#gid=0

The 12 markets are

1. Currency 13 coins
2. Platform 25 coins
3. Ecosystem 7 coins
4. Privacy 11 coins
6. Currency Exchange Tool 8 coins 
7. Gaming & Gambling  5 coins
5. Misc 15 coins
8. Social Network  4 coins
9. Fee Token 3 coins
10. Decentralized Data Storage 4 coins
11. Cloud Computing 3 coins
12. Stable Coin 2 coins

####**Foreword**
Before we look at the individual markets, we need to take a look of the overall market and its biggest issue, scalability, first:
 
Cryptocurrencies aim to be a decentralized currency that can be used worldwide. Their goal is to replace dollar, Euro, Yen, all FIAT currencies globally. The coin that will achieve that will be worth several trillion dollars. 

Bitcoin can only process 7 transactions per second (TPS) currently. In order to replace all FIAT, it would need to perform at least at VISA levels, which usually processes around 3,000 TPS, up to 25,000 TPS during peak times and a maximum of 64,000 TPS.  That means that this cryptocurrency would need to be able to perform at least several thousand TPS. However, a ground breaking technology should not look at current technology to set a goal for its use, i.e. estimating the number of emails sent in 1990 based on the number of faxes sent wasn’t a good estimate.

For that reason, 10,000 TPS is the absolute baseline for a cryptocurrency that wants to replace FIAT. This brings me to IOTA, which wants to connect all 80 billion IoT devices that are expected to exist by 2025, which constantly communicate with each other, possibly creating 80 billion or more transactions per second. This is the benchmark that cryptocurrencies should be aiming for. Currently, 8 billion devices are connected to the Internet.

With its Lightning network recently launched, Bitcoin is realistically looking at 50,000 possible TPS soon. Other notable cryptocurrencies besides IOTA and Bitcoin are Nano with 7,000 TPS already tested, Dash with several billion TPS possible with Masternodes, Neo, LISK and RHOC with 100,000 TPS by 2020, Ripple with 50,000 TPS, Ethereum with 10,000 TPS with Sharding. 

However, it needs to be said that scalability usually goes at the cost of decentralization and security. So, it needs to be seen, which of these technologies can prove themselves decentralized while maintaining high TPS.

Without further ado, here are the coins of the first market. Each market is sorted by market cap.

##Market 1 - Currency:

1. Bitcoin
2. Ripple
3. Bitcoin Cash
4. Litecoin 
5. IOTA
6. Dash
6. Nano
9. Decred
14. Bitcoin Atom
15. Dogecoin
16. Bitcoin Gold
17. Digibyte
19. Bitcoin Diamond 

##Market 2 - Platform
Most of the cryptos here have smart contracts and allow dapps (Decentralized apps) to be build on their platform and to use their token as an exchange of value between dapp services.

1. Ethereum
2. EOS
3. Cardano
4. VeChain
5. Neo
6. Aeternity
8. Stellar
18. Ethereum classic
11. Ziliqa
6. QTUM 
7. Icon
8. LISK
9. Rchain 
10. ARDR
11. Ark
11. Ontology
12. Bytom
13. Nxt 
14. Stratis 
15. Status 
17. Neblio 
18. NEM
19. Bancor
20. Dragonchain
7. Skycoin

##Market 3 - Ecosystem
The 3rd market with 11 coins is comprised of ecosystem coins, which aim to strengthen the ease of use within the crypto space through decentralized exchanges, open standards for apps and more 

1. Nebulas
2. Waves
3. Salt
4. CHAINLINK
6. WTC
7. Ethos 
9. Aion

##Market 4 - Privacy
The 4th market are privacy coins. As you might know, Bitcoin is not anonymous. If the IRS or any other party asks an exchange who is the identity behind a specific Bitcoin address, they know who you are and can track back almost all of the Bitcoin transactions you have ever made and all your account balances. Privacy coins aim to prevent exactly that through address fungability, which changes addresses constantly, IP obfuscation and more. There are 2 types of privacy coins, one with completely privacy and one with optional privacy. Optional Privacy coins like Dash and Nav have the advantage of more user friendliness over completely privacy coins such as Monero and Enigma. However, the question is if full privacy coins will be hindered in growth through government regulations or not or if optional privacy coins will become more successful through ease of use and no regulatory hindrance. 


1. Monero
3. Zcash
4. Verge 
5. Bytecoin 
6. Bitcoin Private
6. Komodo
7. PIVX
8. Zcoin
9. Enigma
10. Navcoin
13. Tenx

##Market 5 - Currency Exchange Tool
Due to the sheer number of different cryptocurrencies, exchanging one currency for the other it still cumbersome. Further, merchants don’t want to deal with overcluttered options of accepting cryptocurrencies. This is where exchange tool like Req come in, which allow easy and simple exchange of currencies. 

1. Cryptonex
2. QASH
3. Kyber
4. Achain
5. Req
6. Bitshares.  
5. Loopring
8. ZRX

##Market 6 - Gaming
With an industry size of $108B worldwide, Gaming is one of the largest markets in the world. For sure, cryptocurrencies will want to have a share of that pie.

1. Storm
2. Fun
4. Electroneum
5. Wax

##Market 7 - Misc
There are various markets being tapped right now. They are all summed up under misc. 

1. OMG 
2. Power ledger
3. Populous
4. Monacoin
5. Revain
3. Augur
6. Substratum
7. Veritaseum 
8. TRON
9. Syscoin
10. Hshare
11. BAT
12. Dent
13. Ncash
14. Factom 

##Market 8 - Social network
Web 2.0 is still going strong and Web 3.0 is not going to ignore it. There are several gaming tokens already out there and a few with decent traction already, such as Steem, which is Reddit with voting through money is a very interesting one.

1. Mithril
2. Steem 
3. Rdd
12. Kin

##Market 9 - Fee token
Popular exchanges realized that they can make a few billion dollars more by launching their own token. Owning these tokens gives you a reduction of trading fees. Very handy and BNB (Binance Coin) has been one of the most resilient tokens, which have withstood most market drops over the last weeks and was among the very few coins that could show growth.

1. BNB
2. Gas
3. Kucoin

##Market 10 - Decentralized Data Storage
Currently, data storage happens with large companies or data centers that are prone to failure or losing data. Decentralized data storage makes loss of data almost impossible by distributing your files to numerous clients that hold tiny pieces of your data. Remember Torrents? Torrents use a peer-to-peer network. It is similar to that. Many users maintain copies of the same file, when someone wants a copy of that file, they send a request to the peer-to-peer network., users who have the file, known as seeds, send fragments of the file to the requester., he requester receives many fragments from many different seeds, and the torrent software recompiles these fragments to form the original file.

1. Gbyte
2. Siacoin
3. Maidsafecoin
4. Storj

##Market 11 - Cloud computing
Obviously, renting computing power, one of the biggest emerging markets as of recent years, e.g. AWS and Digital Ocean, is also a service, which can be bought and managed via the blockchain.

1. Golem
2. Elf

##Market 12 - Stablecoin
Last but not least, there are 3 stablecoins that have established themselves within the market. A stable coin is a coin that wants to be independent of the volatility of the crypto markets. This has worked out pretty well for Maker and DGD, accomplished through a carefully diversified currency fund and backing of each token with 1g of real gold respectively. DO NOT CONFUSE DGD AND MAKER with their STABLE COINS DGX and DAI. DGD and MAKER are volatile, because they are the companies of DGX and DAI. DGX and DAI are the stable coins.

1. DGD
2. Maker
10. USDT

_________________________________________
EDIT: Added a risk factor from 0 to 10. The baseline is 2 for any crypto. Significant scandals, mishaps, shady practices, questionable technology, increase the risk factor. Not having a product yet automatically means a risk factor of 6. Strong adoption and thus strong scrutiny or positive community lower the risk factor.

EDIT2: Added a subjective potential factor from 0 to 10, where its overall potential and a small or big market cap is factored in. Bitcoin with lots of potential only gets a 9, because of its massive market cap, because if Bitcoin goes 10x, smaller coins go 100x, PIVX gets a 10 for being as good as Monero while carrying a 10x smaller market cap, which would make PIVX go 100x if Monero goes 10x.

They are openly robbing 100's of us, and possibly preparing to exit the crypto world with our funds

They have stolen over $2500 from me. But some other people have been ripped off Hundreds of Thousands of dollars. 

There are endless accusations against them them. 
We are attempting to launch Class action. They have locked 100's of people out of their accounts, and are keeping the funds.
HitBTC also monitor Reddit, and always reply on reddit to make the public think they are trying to help. 
They have trolls working around the clock. But when you try to email them
to get your funds back, there is just silence. Nothing. 

They even seem to go as far as having trolls post a complaint on Reddit - then Hitbtc come to the rescue.

But in actual fact, they ban people on their Reddit and Twitter who speak the truth. I was banned for trying to get my $2000 back.

And privately, they are nasty and gloat at the fact that I ""Wont even be able to find them"" to take legal action.


You can google 1000's of other people like myself that have been scammed.
Here are 3 places to start;

Last week I sold all my alts apart from XMR, Komodo and Maid into BTC. Over 90% of my portfolio locked up in our flagship coin.

I’m spooked though, anything can happen with the fork, Tether is looking suspect and BitConnect is a clear Ponzi scheme. It feels like a house of cards ready to crash at any point.

I’m a trader, I’m not a gambler. Right now it is too hard to trade, nobody knows what the fuck will happen, anything can.

I’ve sold the lot. My view is this, if the price crashes I don’t lose anything. If the price rallies I don’t lose anything. There are always new trades to make and I’ll be looking once the fork settles and we know where we are.

It’s been a great year but I am now stress free. I’m not checking prices every 5 minutes and I can go to sleep without the fear of checking prices in the morning.

I hope Bitcoin goes from strength to strength and I hope any traders holding through the fork make good money, I hope Segwit2x burns to the ground.

Good luck all, long live Bitcoin x",173

I actually made the site a few weeks ago just to see if it would actually be something I used. As it turns out, I do! Am I biased? Maybe. But I just know it has been helpful for me so I thought someone else may like it. Whenever I am in my crypto\-news\-consuming mode, a significant portion of my time was typically spent going from site to site. This helps decrease that travel time, at least a little bit. if you like it, use it \- share it. if not, no worries! just thought maybe i wasn't the only one getting frustrated having to go so many places.

Also, sorry if some of it is kind of plain \- i was fairly limited on what i could do in some areas because I am too cheap to pay for the upgraded wordpress packages lol. if there is a good news site or resource or podcast or something that I forgot, let me know and I'll do my best to get it on there! \(some websites make it tough though\). Also, I'm pretty new to making websites, so if there is a feature I should add, let me know that as well.

happy investing everyone!

I just wanted to talk a bit about Stellar. Call this is a shill post if you will, but I'm genuinely interested in this cryptocurrency and truly believe in the potential behind it. I really do encourage all types of discussion, so if you do not agree with some of the points I make, I'm definitely all ears.

When it comes to Stellar, they have a number of a great things going for them. For starters, their payment system is honestly amazing. They can allow people, banks, or anyone, to make payments to anyone in the world(can be both fiat and crypto payments), within 2-5 seconds, for pretty much free (the fee is 0.00001 XLM lol). In this case, it's similar to Ripple, however Ripple stands for everything crypto is NOT supposed to be, while Stellar is the true counterpart (created by Jed Mccaleb) and is registered as a non-profit. They also do not hold any of the outstanding XLM for themselves, but rather will be distributing the lumens over the years to potential partners in order to encourage adoption.

In addition to this payment system, one of Stellar's biggest selling points is it's asset exchange system. You can pay somebody in USD for example, but if you want them to receive in EUR, they will receive it EUR. This is where the potentially truly lies...instant cross asset exchanges. Starting off, Stellar will only be focusing on currencies, but imagine a world where you can instantly exchange any portion of your stock(yes any percentage, does not have to be a whole one) for, lets say, a French dollar. So, not only can you make instant payments, but you can turn this asset into any other asset along the way! Another point, which many might not know, is that you can ICO off Stellar! There have been a few to date, but I'm sure many more will be coming this year.

Now that I've covered the basics of the tech behind it, I wanted to explore the adoption of Stellar a bit. Here is what they have going for them:

1) IBM partnership for global payments which is focused towards bringing big banks on board

2) Stellar itself is focusing on banking the unbanked in developing parts of the world, which is a HUGE market, as well as signing up remittance companies (currently remittance companies charge a very high fee, and they can get around this with Stellar)

3) According to a recent interview with Jed Mccaleb they are working with partners to launch a global venmo...imagine having the power of something like at your disposal

4) Partnered with Deloitte, one of the biggest accounting firms in the world

5) Stripe - They have invested in Stellar, sit on the board, and will most likely add support for a lumen payment option

6) FairX and SDEX, which is speculated to be a fiat to crypto exchange launching soon.

Future seems bright! Thanks for the read everyone, appreciate it.",54

Have you been curious as to when the market shifts based on the day of the week or special times in the year? When is the best day of the week to sell and best day of the week to buy? Well I looked into it and created some tables. Some things to know:

* Dates: January 18, 2017 - January 17, 2018
* Top 10 coins/tokens based on current market cap that have a full 365 days worth of data
* The change in price is reflective of the opening price each day
* I used US, China, and S. Korea Holidays, but more can be added if they are relevant to market prices.
* I used all relevant holidays and special dates that I could find for the 3 countries. If there are more to add, please let me know for version 2.0 of this sheet (Version 2.0 will include data from the top 25 coins/tokens)
* The 4 charts in the link below are for days of the week, US holidays, China holidays, and S. Korea holidays.

[4 Interesting Charts](https://imgur.com/wLMXpIg)

Some conclusions:

* New year's eve was the biggest buy day of the major holidays
* New year's day was the biggest sell day of the major holidays.
* Tuesday was the most popular day for an increase, suggesting you should sell on these days.
* Saturday was the least popular day for an increase, suggesting you should buy on these days.
* October 4 and 5 were both significant days in China and S. Korea for holidays, and both showed a decrease in the market.
* Holidays in May were all shown to have increases in the market, regardless of the country.


I hope you all enjoy this, and let me know what you all would like to see for version 2.0.

Guys,
First let me say that I own VeChain, but this post is way beyond my personal investment but instead I’d like to provide a fresh look into why VeChain as we the best investments in Blockchain technology for years to come.
The market today is all about FOMO and hype, and that’s absolutely fine, the market can continue and increase in total Cap for years to come, but eventually the blockchain and its related tokens will need serious adoption to utilize and incentivise each project.
Many of the amazing projects with super high valuation (i.e.: IOTA, EOS…) are just speculation and it may be that they can deliver and all will be well.


However, VeChain is VERY different, as explained by Sunny Lu, the CEO of VeChain.

VeChain is building business relations FIRST and letting its customers dictate the path forward. 
With already agreements in place with the Chinese national Govt as well as many other multi billion dollar companies:

===============================

Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media Ltd.

BitOcean

Healthcare Co. Ltd

Xiamen Innov Information Technology Co Ltd

A Global Convenience Store Franchise

Looking Into Who Is Jiangsu Printed Electronics

VeChain teams up with Madeforgoods | CN press release

VeChain affirms partnership with China Unicom

Global strategic cooperation with DNV GL

Groupe Renault teams with Microsoft and...

World’s Largest Freight Company to Use Blockchain Tech for Asset Management

PwC CN: VeChain S.E.A. becomes a portfolio company of PwC’s incubation...

Babyghost and VeChain: Fashion on the Blockchain - Nasdaq.com

China’s Largest Wine Importer Wants to Place Wine on a Private Blockchain

Bright Fishery (officially announced in weekly report vol.6)

And many more with signed NDAs (BMW rumered and more…)

VeChain is positioning itself to be in high demand and usage for years to come. 

VeChain is re-banding itself as VET VeChain/Thor (instead of just VEN) and will deliver a revolutionary new Blockchain-X in Q2 of 2018. With 
the rebranding they announced a passive income system through proof of stake which is bound to create generous returns for anyone holding 10K of VET or more.


===============================

What I think many people are missing is the fact that even if the entire Crypto market crashed (which I don’t see happening at 700B which is still low), the VeChain/Thor will thrive due to the need for its technology and business partners which will adopt the technology in 2018.
So when you are investing in VeChain, you are getting a double reward. If the Crypto market doubles in total Cap, you VET will be worth substentilaly more, but even the market has peaked, the fact that the VeChain ECO system will thrive (and it is a fact IMHO due to the many business relationships) your VET will create a very high ROI. VeChain is exceeding all expectations when it comes to its enterprise market penetration and we are all in January (testnet will be released Q2 of 2018). 

===============================


The investment world is taking notice as Breyercapital and other investment firms are adding VeChain to its very limited blockchain profolio. 
So I know what you must be thinking, well it all sounds nice and well, so why did VeChain only go up 10x in  past month and not 100x. 
Well the answer is simply (and I got proof). Whales (many of them Chinese) are well aware that VeChain will be a top player in the crypto work and are trying to gain as many VET as they can before the tokens gets up really high in value. And so market manipulation is happening in unprecedented fashion (never seen anything like it in any other coin) and high sell walls and 
continues re-buys to force the price to remain low so they can accumulate.
Here is a proof: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8k6w5cen3ryu2yt/Chart.png?dl=0
Whales are trying to get enough VET so they own a Mjolnir master node which can pay close to 1,000,000.00 a year if and when the price of VET gets to $25.00 
See here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bfgixylquemgtby/VET.jpg?dl=0

===============================

I honestly believe the price will climb well above $100 USD before Q2 2018 as VeChain is a game changing blockchain company in its approach to business relations first and adoption second.
This is giving everyone an opportunity to get in now before the Whales stop price manipulation (eventually they will stop since they have accumulated enough and wish to the price climb themselves). I honestly believe this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and this is the reason for my first real post in Reddit Blockchain (all my other posts are on programming Google Angular :)
Now let me prove to you that the writing is on the wall.



This morning the market crashed +20% and yet you can see that ONLY VeChain is maintaining it’s price, that is because the Whales auto orders are buying everything they can below and above a certain price.  As you can see from my snapshot from 8AM this morning:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/2aeki6xbwdwjt75/Market.JPG?dl=0
I know many of you think that if you buy into VeChain now you are getting it at its all time high, but in a year you will look back at its current market Cap of 1.5B and you will be amazed at how undervalue it has been (this is my personal opinion and not financial advice).
Now don’t take my word for it, always do your own research.
I do highly recommend you watch the very popular Boxmining video on VeChain:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH2G_44x4vw&t=767s
as well as:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42_YmVGs5MA&t=300s


===============================

and most importantly the VeChain THOR Power Forged AMA:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWoEsBQFozM
The opportunity here is mind boggling and while it goes without saying that I have a VET and would like to see it rise in price, I am sure this single post is not going to make even a small dent in its high volume trading and so I am not posting this for my own benefit but instead to open everyone’s eyes to this amazing opportunity. I am an Angular developer and I spend hundreds of hours developing open source code which is posted on GitHub for the benefit of the Angular community and so I am used to giving back (you can see my Reddit ratings and post history of years). It’s just the first time I am doing the same for the Crypto community,

===============================

Happy new year and good luck,


Sean.

How many people have told you that cryptocurrencies are too risky? A fraud? A
Ponzi Scheme?

**Bitcoin has increased over 1,500% over the last year**, but none of this is
new. Cryptocurrencies have been on a tear unlike anything we have ever seen…just
look at how it compares to the various bubbles of the past:

*Full Disclosure: not calling it a bubble…just providing context!*

[Comparison of Bitcoin to Past Bubbles](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*8rJh4eLCMoTZ-ZrUp1JAIQ.jpeg)

But you…you are a **savvy investor**.

Outsized gains tell us nothing except **something increased from a little to
alot**.

## Total Returns are not adjusted for risk

Let’s take the following quiz…one is the right answer, but you won’t be graded
for it.

**Which of the following investments would you rather be in?**

1.  Crypto A started at $1, went to $500, back down to $1, back up to $600
1.  Crypto B started at $1, went to $100, to $300, to $600

Both investments have the same return, but which would you choose?

I’ll give you some ti…oh you already have an answer? You choose #2?

**Exactly.**

Most investors look at total returns over various timeframes — one-day,
one-month, one-year— when evaluating an investment. **These returns are
misleading since they aren’t adjusted for risk**.

Just look at the example above —Crypto A made a massive return on the initial
investment, but that does not mean it was a compelling investment opportunity.

> “Using volatility as a measure of risk is nuts. Risk to us is 1) the risk of
> permanent loss of capital, or 2) the risk of inadequate return.” — Charlie
Munger

If only there was a better way…

## What is the Sharpe Ratio?

[The ELI5 Version of the Sharpe Ratio](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*bsWK2jozQar9k7ZwQCrgeg.png)

The Sharpe ratio is a measure used heavily in the finance world for calculating
risk-adjusted returns.

The calculation solves the issue of misleading total returns by taking the
average return earned above the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total
risk — an absolute measure of risk.

Investors can directly compare multiple investments and evaluate the amount of
risk taken on to generate the same percentage points of return, **which makes
for a much fairer comparison**.

While this does make for a much better comparison, you are smart and know that
even though something may have a higher Sharpe Ratio, that does not indicate it
is less volatile…the higher ratio actually indicated that the investment
risk-to-reward profile is much better or proportional vs. another.

So for this article, I will show you how to implement the Sharpe Ratio in the
wonderful world of cryptocurrencies.

## Top Cryptocurrencies by Sharpe Ratio

With your new, sweet investment tool, you can calculate the Sharpe Ratios of top
cryptocurrencies.

But because I love you (and to save time), I went ahead and did it for you:

[Top 12 Cryptocurrencies by Sharpe Ratio](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*mRR09Qh9t2zsJKWdyOCCgA.png)

Not surprisingly, Bitcoin ranks as the top risk-adjusted earning cryptocurrency
from the top 12. Even though Bitcoin is very volatile, the returns have matched
the craziness.

What is interesting to me, is all the way at the bottom — our dear friend NEO,
aka the “Chinese Ethereum”. A Sharpe Ratio of 0.03 in an industry of 1s, 2s, 3s,
and a 4 is honestly…terrible. But a large portion of this is due to NEO
stumbling out of the gate after getting listed on Bitfinex, with returns of
-18%, -13%, and -24% in the first 10 days of trading.

## My Gift to you — a tool to automatically calculate Sharpe Ratio

A post from me would not be complete without a tool for you to utilize what we
just talked about.

The spreadsheet pulls in the top 12 cryptocurrencies from the Bitfinex exchange,
and calculates the Sharpe Ratio for each.

The user can modify the risk free rate, calculations, and any of the currencies
currently being pulled.

**First time install**

The tool is nice and simple to use. It requires about
2 minutes to setup, then after that you are good to go.

It’s kinda like how anyone who smokes pot is a “stoner” and must enjoy the 420 culture (clothing and accessories adorned with pot leafs, the “420 bruh!” types, etc). People are absolutely blown away to discover that people in the 6 and 7 figure salary windows smoke daily. They don’t fit the “420 Bruh!” mold. 

Eventually someone not in the community is gonna see “HODL” and take it all, everything we do and talk about, as a joke. If we can’t take ourselves seriously with this, why should/would anyone else?

We've done this before but often the threads just become cluttered, so I'm going to try to keep this one more organized.

[Upfiring](https://upfiring.com): ICO going on now. Really unique project that has the potential to be a gold mine. It's P2P file-sharing but seeders get compensated with UFR tokens. This could completely take uTorrent/BitTorrents market cap as people will definitely want to seed files on this app and get tokens for it. I myself would use this app if successfully made, and with that low of a market cap the potential is huge here.  

[RedPulse](https://coin.red-pulse.com/): ICO starts today, Whitelist is already closed (I think?). ""China’s economy is already the 2nd largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP, and 1st in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). However, as a market for investment and industry participation, it remains incredibly difficult to understand. This disconnect presents a huge opportunity to platforms and services that can bridge this informational gap. The problem is made all the more challenging to solve by several critical circumstances.""

[EnjinCoin](https://EnjinCoin.io): ICO is going on now. Really big market for this type of thing, the e-Sports market and crypto will be a realistic use case in the future. I love this project and think people will actually use it, as opposed to 99% of the other projects which sound great but have no real uses. 

[Airswap](https://www.airswap.io): Decentralized exchange like 0x. Really cool project, will be watching this one. 

Grid+: ICO starts October 30. ""Grid+ leverages the Ethereum blockchain to give consumers direct access to wholesale energy markets. This decreases costs, shifts production closer to demand, and moves us all toward a cleaner energy future."" (Backed by Consensys)

Salt - Blockchain-based loans.

DNT - We've already seen it at 4x this price, so it could happen again. The project itself is alright. 

I will actively add projects as they are suggested here.

NIX, it will be launching to mainnet in a month. No ICO and sick team. Check it out:

Pursuing the objective of becoming the first DEX Manager in the market, NIX will initially incorporate Blocknet, a peer-to-peer protocol between nodes on different blockchains. Additionally, the team consists of several new experienced developers and a lead cryptographer who is a doctoral researcher in the cryptography field. 

NIX will create its own privacy protocol: The Ghost Protocol, a custom code which involves the Zerocoin Protocol plus the utilization of Stealth Addresses in order to make transactions untraceable with no trusted parties and with a higher level of anonymity, Bulletproofs to conceal transaction value and shrink the size of the cryptographic proof, the integration of a Lightning Network to allow fast blockchain payments, and the creation of an Atomic Swaps Architecture with the intention of performing decentralized operations from a node on any blockchain to another.

With the implementation of NIX, every single supported coin will have the possibility of being traded privately in a prompt, secure and decentralized manner, as the process consists of swapping coin A for NIX, progressively applying the Ghost Protocol, having as a result NIX with no previous transaction history and finally swapping NIX for coin B. Simple, private, fast.

The tool tracks top gainers and losers for a specified interval of time. You can track price % gains as well as market cap gains (if ETH gains 1% - thats much more than if a shitcoin gains 10%).

This interface has live update, so you can leave it running on ""NOW"" setting and watch for spikes.

This should work for desktop and mobile. Let me know if you find bugs, or you think that the search is too complicated. I may need add some informational tips or make it simpler and put some stuff into Advanced Options.

""Why alt should I buy"" - everyone just names whatever they are holding

The key is to ask WHY, ask for pros AND CONS. 

""It's got a great team"" - that's not enough, how big is the team, what kind of credentials do they have, have they been involved in a scam coin before, and so on

And remember you're still receiving a sales pitch. 

Linked to a Youtube video? it's often just another ""crypto-expert"" gushing over ""how great"" yet another coin is, because they've just bought it

Even news from crypto ""news"" sites is rarely objective, at the bottom of practically every article is a disclaimer that they or the company that owns them has a holding in those coins

Be skeptical. Once someone can give you a decent overview of a coin, do your own research from there, read the whitepaper and so on.

A pretty comprehensive review of the pros and cons at time of ICO is here... https://medium.com/ibbc-io/request-network-ico-review-2f911152d613

**Pros**

 - Many use cases, including payment requests, auditing, invoicing and donations to NGOs

 - Team is one of the only coins backed by YCombinator (and is also loosely working with ING Bank, though it is not an official financial backing according to my research)

 - The inherently linked Request platform will allow businesses to utilize it for paying salaries, payments, auditing, accounting, funding etc. (assuming devs built these dapps).

 - Active reddit community (r/RequestNetwork) and +20,000 Slack users

 - Is working closely with QuantStamp, another YCombinator company

 - Aims to discuss secure request system with Worldbank, IMF, ECB and UN by 2Q18

 - Colossus Update, full working alpha, will be launched within next two weeks before next dev update

 - Is tradable on Binance and just cracked the top 85 in coin market cap

 - Team is experienced, having raised six rounds of funding at Moneytis in past, a money transfer system used for sending Fiat between two countries

**Cons**

 - We are still **very** early in the roadmap https://request.network/#/

 - REQ does face some competition from OmiseGO (OMG), though it's possible the two will complement each other.  Good read on this here: https://blog.request.network/omisego-vs-request-network-a-detailed-analysis-779d1f66675b

 - There are also traditional competitors like PayPal and Venmo that allow sellers to send invoice requests to people, though I would note that it's not possible (yet) to send requests in crypto form on those platforms

 - May face regulatory challenges

So I decided to check 3 random services and hope you'll help me to pick the best one for me. I'm sorry if you won't agree with me as I'm new to it. So I am ready to hear your opinion and your choise in that niche.

&#x200B;

1. Binance

&#x200B;

The first thing I've mentioned is that I have to enter my email in order to create the account. It looks strange, especially when everyone worry about their privacy. It's a minus, I think. 

&#x200B;

The good thing is that it promises to have the lowest trading fees which is very important. But I can change only crypto-pairs on Binance, so when I'll decide to change crypto to USD for withdrawal - I'll have to look for another place.

&#x200B;

On the whole, it's very easy to create a wallet there and do different kinds of exchanges.

&#x200B;

2. Coinbase

&#x200B;

And the same thing from the beginning - it asks for email during the registration. Guys, have you heard of privacy?

&#x200B;

This platform is well-known as the best exchange website for crypto newbies. It deals with the major coins only and it provides a lot of trading volume and liquidity. I think that it can suit me.

&#x200B;

To tell the truth there's nothing more to say about that service, just that it's easy to use and widely known. 

&#x200B;

3. EtherMium

&#x200B;

EtherMium is an example of a decentralized exchange service. Moreover it doesn't require any registration in order to create a wallet, which is very important for privacy as I understood. 

&#x200B;

It has an advantage over the centralized cervices - the trading is anonymous there, unless you identify your wallet as being yours. I like the point that I can create Ethereum wallet but it's posible to exchange only tokens there. So if I'll prefer the major coins - it will not suit me. 

&#x200B;

But if I'll do token trading - I could take part in affiliate program and get 50% from the profit. It's a good bonus, I think.

&#x200B;

On the whole, the service is good-looking, easy to navigate but it really lacks major coins. 

&#x200B;

So what can you advice me to try? Are these services good or it's better to choose something else?",0

Okay, at least with passing time, we are seeing less of useless forks. Why? I truly believe by next bull run, most useless forks will fail to gain traction, and original ideas will dominate the top 10.

2. Bye bye shitcoin. If this market continues for next 3 months, I can bet it will spell doom for a lot of shitcoins. Lets say, like bitcoin gold, diamond, platinum etc.

3. Less of btc vs bch feud. Lets face it. The well being of the crypto space does depend on original ideas. While btc is an original idea. Bch isn't

4. No more lambo people till next bull. How many lambo or moon posts do we see in reddit? Nope. Not really. Vitalik must be damn happy, that there's at least some serious investors (or hodlers or gamblers) with some skin in the game

5. More FUD resistance. Well consider this just like a vaccination. Yeah, we all take Vaccines. We all have that Fever that follows vaccines. The bit of illness, weakness, but then it does protect us from a terrible infection.

6. Opportunity to be a real Millionaire. Yes. The bubble hasn't even started. How will it pop. If a 800 billion market with almost 40 to 60 projects that have got products is a bubble, well I dunno what the debt Bubble is. Maybe it's a superbubble. 

7. Mass adoption. Technology will advance. I don't think people like vitalik, charlie, charles hoskinson, colin lemahieu, da hongfei, Cz of binance are doing it just to be a millionaire. With tech advance we will see adoption rates  going up. After using nano, I seriously question, why should I use Visa Cards!

8. More btc alt decoupling. I would like this to happen at the soonest. Why? A lot of pump and dumps happen just to farm satoshis. Also a lot of alts get a fake dollar valuation due to the BTC value. So coins like XP or Pac continue to have valuations based on that.

9. Killer dApps, interoperability and more. platforms and payments solutions products are my pick for the next bull run. Yours?",102

Coins in the Top 10 get the most attention - and I’ve observed huge money pumping into coins that have a “perceived” low entry point - iota, xrp, ada. 

Psychological small investors think they are getting a better deal and can make a lot more money. Whales know that people are thinking this, so they pump billlions into these coins which lights the fire to bring the masses - like a moth to a light.

Stellar is primed - it’s now a top 10 coin with the lowest perceived entry point by a long shot. Combine that with the fact it’s backed by IBM, Wells Fargo and has just announced the FairX app on the horizon.

Why we're in a bubble, you ask? Because there's a ton of coins at the moment, and the majority have been going up crazily for a few weeks/months (since BTC started growing like crazy months ago).

It's fair to assume that the vast majority of these coins are either scams, PnD schemes, or won't simply stand the test of time. So why are they all growing 50% a week? Because it's a bubble and even grandmas are starting to invest in this gold rush. You see SuperCoin5000 has gone from $0.01 to $15 in 2 weeks and think it's the next Bitcoin. It's probably not.

Read up the whitepapers, re-read them until you understand what's going on, read up on all criticism you can find online, read the dedicated subreddits with a lot of salt, think ""would I use this coin for some practical purpose?"", and then make your decision. You'd probably pick a couple coins, and ignore most of them.

And, super cliché, don't invest what you're prepared to completely lose.

TLDR: BTC is centralized and filled with misinformation/censorships and controlled by a single entity. However, their propaganda has worked wonders and made many people think the opposite. The fact is, Bitcoin Cash is magnitudes more decentralized in terms of miners, multiple independent development/research teams, etc. There are 3 things that cannot be hidden for long; the sun, the moon, and the truth. Educate yourself and spread the truth. This is the only way to make a stand against misinformation and censorships.

People should get the full story of r/bitcoin because it is probably one of the strangest of all reddit subs.

r/bitcoin, the main sub for the bitcoin community is held and run by a person who goes by the pseudonym u/theymos. Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.

For most of bitcoin's history this did not create a problem (at least not an obvious one anyway) until around mid 2015. This happened to be around the time a new player appeared on the scene, a for-profit company called Blockstream. Blockstream was made up of/hired many (but not all) of the main bitcoin developers. (To be clear, Blockstream was founded before mid 2015 but did not become publicly active until then). A lot of people, including myself, tried to point out there we're some very serious potential conflicts of interest that could arise when one single company controls most of the main developers for the biggest decentralised and distributed cryptocurrency. There were a lot of unknowns but people seemed to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were apparently about to release some new software called ""sidechains"" that could offer some benefits to the network.

Not long after Blockstream came on the scene the issue of bitcoin's scalability once again came to forefront of the community. This issue came within the community a number of times since bitcoins inception. Bitcoin, as dictated in the code, cannot handle any more than around 3 transactions per second at the moment. To put that in perspective Paypal handles around 15 transactions per second on average and VISA handles something like 2000 transactions per second. The discussion in the community has been around how best to allow bitcoin to scale to allow a higher number of transactions in a given amount of time. I suggest that if anyone is interested in learning more about this problem from a technical angle, they go to r/btc and do a search. It's a complex issue but for many who have followed bitcoin for many years, the possible solutions seem relatively obvious. Essentially, currently the limit is put in place in just a few lines of code. This was not originally present when bitcoin was first released. It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network. Because all bitcoin transactions have to be stored forever on the bitcoin network, someone could theoretically simply transmit a large number of transactions which would have to be stored by the entire network forever. When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free as the only people running the network were enthusiasts. In fact a single bitcoin did not even have any specific value so it would be impossible set a fee value. This meant that a malicious person could make the size of the bitcoin ledger grow very rapidly without much/any cost which would stop people from wanting to join the network due to the resource requirements needed to store it, which at the time would have been for very little gain.

Towards the end of the summer last year, this bitcoin scaling debate surfaced again as it was becoming clear that the transaction limit for bitcoin was semi regularly being reached and that it would not be long until it would be regularly hit and the network would become congested. This was a very serious issue for a currency. Bitcoin had made progress over the years to the point of retailers starting to offer it as a payment option. Bitcoin companies like, Microsoft, Paypal, Steam and many more had began to adopt it. If the transaction limit would be constantly maxed out, the network would become unreliable and slow for users. Users and businesses would not be able to make a reliable estimate when their transaction would be confirmed by the network.

Users, developers and businesses (which at the time was pretty much the only real bitcoin subreddit) started to discuss how we should solve the problem r/bitcoin. There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andreesen. Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands. Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed. For most of bitcoin's history the transaction limit had been set far far higher than the number of transactions that could potentially happen on the network. The concept of increasing the limit one time was based on the fact that history had proven that no issue had been cause by this in the past.

A certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous. They said that the increased use of resources that the network would use would create centralisation pressures which could destroy the network. The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners. The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream. The argument from people in support of increasing the transaction capacity by this amount was that there are always inherent centralisation pressure with bitcoin mining. For example miners who can access the cheapest electricity will tend to succeed and that bigger miners will be able to find this cheaper electricity easier. Miners who have access to the most efficient computer chips will tend to succeed and that larger miners are more likely to be able to afford the development of them. The argument from Gavin and other who supported increasing the transaction capacity by this method are essentially there are economies of scale in mining and that these economies have far bigger centralisation pressures than increased resource cost for a larger number of transactions (up to the new limit proposed). For example, at the time the total size of the blockchain was around 50GB. Even for the cost of a 500GB SSD is only $150 and would last a number of years. This is in-comparison to the $100,000's in revenue per day a miner would be making.

Various developers put forth various other proposals, including Gavin Andresen who put forth a more conservative increase that would then continue to increase over time inline with technological improvements. Some of the employees of blockstream also put forth some proposals, but all were so conservative, it would take bitcoin many decades before it could reach a scale of VISA. Even though there was significant support from the community behind Gavin's simple proposal of increasing the limit it was becoming clear certain members of the bitcoin community who were part of Blockstream were starting to become increasingly vitriolic and divisive. Gavin then teamed up with one of the other main bitcoin developers Mike Hearn and released a coded (i.e. working) version of the bitcoin software that would only activate if it was supported by a significant majority of the network. What happened next was where things really started to get weird.

After this free and open source software was released, Theymos, the person who controls all the main communication channels for the bitcoin community implemented a new moderation policy that disallowed any discussion of this new software. Specifically, if people were to discuss this software, their comments would be deleted and ultimately they would be banned temporarily or permanently. This caused chaos within the community as there was very clear support for this software at the time and it seemed our best hope for finally solving the problem and moving on. Instead a censorship campaign was started. At first it 'all' they were doing was banning and removing discussions but after a while it turned into actively manipulating the discussion. For example, if a thread was created where there was positive sentiment for increasing the transaction capacity or being negative about the moderation policies or negative about the actions of certain bitcoin developers, the mods of r/bitcoin would selectively change the sorting order of threads to 'controversial' so that the most support opinions would be sorted to the bottom of the thread and the most vitriolic would be sorted to the top of the thread. This was initially very transparent as it was possible to see that the most downvoted comments were at the top and some of the most upvoted were at the bottom. So they then implemented hiding the voting scores next to the users name. This made impossible to work out the sentiment of the community and when combined with selectively setting the sorting order to controversial it was possible control what information users were seeing. Also, due to the very very large number of removed comments and users it was becoming obvious the scale of censorship going on. To hide this they implemented code in their CSS for the sub that completely hid comments that they had removed so that the censorship itself was hidden. Anyone in support of scaling bitcoin were removed from the main communication channels. Theymos even proudly announced that he didn't care if he had to remove 90% of the users. He also later acknowledged that he knew he had the ability to block support of this software using the control he had over the communication channels.

While this was all going on, Blockstream and it's employees started lobbying the community by paying for conferences about scaling bitcoin, but with the very very strange rule that no decisions could be made and no complete solutions could be proposed. These conferences were likely strategically (and successfully) created to stunt support for the scaling software Gavin and Mike had released by forcing the community to take a ""lets wait and see what comes from the conferences"" kind of approach. Since no final solutions were allowed at these conferences, they only served to hinder and splinter the communities efforts to find a solution. As the software Gavin and Mike released called BitcoinXT gained support it started to be attacked. Users of the software were attack by DDOS. Employees of Blockstream were recommending attacks against the software, such as faking support for it, to only then drop support at the last moment to put the network in disarray. Blockstream employees were also publicly talking about suing Gavin and Mike from various different angles simply for releasing this open source software that no one was forced to run. In the end Mike Hearn decided to leave due to the way many members of the bitcoin community had treated him. This was due to the massive disinformation campaign against him on r/bitcoin. One of the many tactics that are used against anyone who does not support Blockstream and the bitcoin developers who work for them is that you will be targeted in a smear campaign. This has happened to a number of individuals and companies who showed support for scaling bitcoin. Theymos has threatened companies that he will ban any discussion of them on the communication channels he controls (i.e. all the main ones) for simply running software that he disagrees with (i.e. any software that scales bitcoin).

As time passed, more and more proposals were offered, all against the backdrop of ever increasing censorship in the main bitcoin communication channels. It finally come down the smallest and most conservative solution. This solution was much smaller than even the employees of Blockstream had proposed months earlier. As usual there was enormous attacks from all sides and the most vocal opponents were the employees of Blockstream. These attacks still are ongoing today. As this software started to gain support, Blockstream organised more meetings, especially with the biggest bitcoin miners and made a pact with them. They promised that they would release code that would offer an on-chain scaling solution hardfork within about 4 months, but if the miners wanted this they would have to commit to running their software and only their software. The miners agreed and the ended up not running the most conservative proposal possible. This was in February last year. There is no hardfork proposal in sight from the people who agreed to this pact and bitcoin is still stuck with the exact same transaction limit it has had since the limit was put in place about 6 years ago. Gavin has also been publicly smeared by the developers at Blockstream and a plot was made against him to have him removed from the development team. Gavin has now been, for all intents an purposes, expelled from bitcoin development. This has meant that all control of bitcoin development is in the hands of the developers working at Blockstream.

There is a new proposal that offers a market based approach to scaling bitcoin. This essentially lets the market decide. Of course, as usual there has been attacks against it, and verbal attacks from the employees of Blockstream. This has the biggest chance of gaining wide support and solving the problem for good.

To give you an idea of Blockstream; It has hired most of the main and active bitcoin developers and is now synonymous with the ""Core"" bitcoin development team. They AFAIK no products at all. They have received around $75m in funding. Every single thing they do is supported by /u/theymos. They have started implementing an entirely new economic system for bitcoin against the will of it's users and have blocked any and all attempts to scaling the network in line with the original vision.

Although this comment is ridiculously long, it really only covers the tip of the iceberg. You could write a book on the last two years of bitcoin. The things that have been going on have been mind blowing. One last thing that I think is worth talking about is the u/bashco's claim of vote manipulation.

The users that the video talks about have very very large numbers of downvotes mostly due to them having a very very high chance of being astroturfers. Around about the same time last year when Blockstream came active on the scene every single bitcoin troll disappeared, and I mean literally every single one. In the years before that there were a large number of active anti-bitcoin trolls. They even have an active sub r/buttcoin. Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/bitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of ""bitcoin is shit"", ""You guys and your tulips"" etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the 10's of thousands of users were censored and expelled from r/bitcoin they ended up congregating in r/btc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to r/btc and spend all day everyday posting troll-like comments and misinformation. Naturally they get heavily downvoted by the real users in r/btc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity they scream about ""censorship"" in r/btc while they are happy about the censorship in r/bitcoin. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out, is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effective form of psychological attack.

You may remember from my last post [Top crypto picks for 2018: building a futureproof portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/7mzpea/top_crypto_picks_for_2018_building_a_futureproof). I had such an overwhelming positive response of people sending me PM's commenting how much money they made because of my post, I've decided to share my updated portfolio picks. 

**My methodology**

Same as before. The golden rules I follow when investing keep me from chasing pumps and dumps and ensure I'm invested in solid, usable and futureproof trechnology. I think the most important rule is to not chase pump and dumps. Research every coin that you think has potential and make decisions from there.

Personally I only invest in coins with:

 * Solid and usable technology

 * Clear future use-case

 * Transparent researchable team

 * Evidence of active GitHub or code or working product

 * Token has value within the project (inherently part of the ecosystem)

If a coin is missing one of these characteristics, it needs to be super strong in another field to make up for it. Honestly the biggest gains I have made are the projects I researched thoroughly, believed in and then HODLed, even through all the dips.

**Core picks**

These are my blue-chip shares: the projects I believe have proved themself worthy of the long hold.They will hold (relative) value through dips but still have the potential to increase exponentially with adoption. You'll notice most of them are platforms, not specific projects. Most of my reasoning behind this is because while singular projects may multiple in value, platforms will increase in value exponentialy.

 * **[Ethereum](http://wcibtc.com/ethereum)** - Ethereum is currently without doubt the leading smart contract and trading cryptocurrency platform.  If you've ever taken a glance over the top 300ish coins, you would be astonished by how many of them are ERC20 Ethereum based tokens. With it's fast and cheap transactions, Eth is always my go-to mode for transfering and buying crypto. 

 * **[IOTA](http://wcibtc.com/iota)** - DAG based data-network build for machine to machine transactions where you complete proof of work for 2 other transactions before yours is processed. People also seem to forget that IOTA software is only half of the picture; The IOTA devs have been working on processor hardware that can complete proof of work at a machine level. The IOTA Foundation (non-profit) has been hiring some of the best names in crypto over the last year and they have a great number of partnerships with technology giants, including Robert Bosch Engineering RND, one of the leading chip technology developers in the world. IOTA is still a beta product, but if they keep shooting goals at the current rate their network will rival that of current blockchain infrastructure.

 * **[Neo](http://wcibtc.com/neo)** - Smart contract and do-it-all platform. Often refered to as chinese ethereum with good reason. NEO has a huge developer community and HongFei has tweeted recently about being in talks with the Chinese government to provide a standardised platform to stick to their regulations. Perfect vehicle for Chinese capital to flow into the crypto ecosystem.

 * **[Monero](http://wcibtc.com/xmr)** - The best privacy coin. As long as everyone is able to see all your transaction and wallet history, crypto will never be suitable for real-world adoption. Monero is the number one competitor in the privacy space (at the current time). Excitingly, Monero has a major update planned for March 2018, with their planned release of their BulletProofs update. This update is expected to greatly decrease both transactions times and fees while reduced the memory requirements of their software. 

 * **[Stellar](http://wcibtc.com/xlm)** - Since my last post, I've had the oppurtunity to research Stellar is much greater details, and I have been thoroughly impressed with what I have found. Honestly, their partnership with IBM speaks more then I can shill, with IBM running many of their public nodes, showing their public backing of this project. Most exciting is FairX exchange that Stellar is launching 2018 which will offer both altcoin and fiat trading pairs. Rumoured to be a much needed direct competitor for Coinbase.

 * **[Request Network](http://wcibtc.com/req)** - Edited this in! Can't believe I forgot REQ. Request Network is a full suite of auditing and financial tools including payment processing and fiat to alt coin conversion. REQ is backed by tech kickstarter YCombinator. They have now released their test net running on the Ethereum Rinkeby network, and are set for mainnet release in Q1 2018. If REQ achieves it's vision, it will completely revolutionize the financial and auditing industries.

 * **[Factom](http://wcibtc.com/factom)** - A token which builds off other blockchains to store financial contracts and data. Multiple grants from Dept of Homeland Security and Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. Working with Linxens (one of the largest RFID and passport manufacturers in the world) on Smart Identity products. They already have multiple Fortune 100 customers that will be annouced in Q1 2018 who are already implementing their products. Factom is one of the best blockchain technology usage cases I have ever seen.

**Trading picks**

While I wouldn't consider these picks risky by my methodology, they lack the long term credibility and are probably more prone to volatile behaviour. Higher volatility means higher potential gains, but higher chance of loss. At this stage, I don't plan on really holding any of them super long term, but they may be good for some short-term gains.

 * **[UTrust](http://wcibtc.com/utrust)** - Payment platform system with the world's first inbuilt cryptocurrency consumer protections. Utrust has largely missed the hype that has driven REQ price in the last week and there is certainly potential for them to gain ground in the payment platform sector. 

 * **[Lamden Tau](http://wcibtc.com/lamden)** - A suite of developer tools that speed up the process of creating new and custom blockchains and apps. I haven't had a chance to fully read up on how they plan on implementing their toolset but they have a highly professional team with set usecase and roadmap. Only available on EtherDelta currently so it's a bit of a dark horse.

 * **[Chainlink](http://wcibtc.com/chainlink)** - Decentralized oracles for linking real world applications with blockchain applications. I called this on my last post and it has tripled in price since. Chainlink is the next step to blockchain technology intregration and it currently has no real competitors in this space. Chainlink's potential is unbelievable. 

 * **[Quantstamp](http://wcibtc.com/quantstamp)** - Smart Contract auditing. Token holders also receive a free airdrop of every smart contract they audit. Just like Request Network, QSP is backed by kickstart YComb giving it some of the best tech connections a company could hope for. 

 * **[Horizon State Decision Token](http://wcibtc.com/decision-token)** - An australian startup focusing on providing a immutable polling and election results. They already have their product integrated in MiVote and are launching fully this year. This type of immutable data storage is the perfect example of the power that blockchain technology can have in real world applications, especially with such controversy surrounding recent elections. Imagine how much simpiler 2020 elections would be with this technology being used ;)

 * **[Modum](http://wcibtc.com/modum)** - Real time tracking for (legal) drugs in Europe. Credible team and has a working product. Modum has been one of the tokens that has a real-world usecase, but has been largely ignored mostly because (i think?) people tend to flock to the larger chinese startups like Walton & Wabi.  Modum already has existing customers and existing revenue, it can only go up with adoption.

 * **[Raiblocks](http://wcibtc.com/raiblocks)** - I've dropped this from a core pick to a trading pick. I love Raiblocks. I love it's free and fast transactions. But it lacks the development infrastructure. I know the dev team is working on this and I love that it has a huge future ahead of it, but I'm not ready to go all in with the recent 30x in price. I jsut think the development has a little catching up to do on the pricetag. Bright future ahead. 

 * **[Binance Coin](http://wcibtc.com/binance-coin) / [Kucoin Shares](http://wcibtc.com/kucoin-shares)** - I'll lump these two in together because they have almost identical use-cases and purposes. Binance is now the number one altcoin exchange in the world - Their token is used to lower fees and they have been burning them to lower supply. Kucoin Shares give the holder a small percentage of every transaction fee that the exchange takes. It's honestly hard to value these kinds of coins but they both hold critical roles with-in their respective exchanges.

Feel free to share in the comments your top picks for a balanced portfolio. 

2018 is going to be a great year for crypto!

Lets see how I do.,"I'm gonna parse this by saying the folliowing, while I am a degenerate, I am not an addict. I just like to bet on sports and play Pot Limit Omaha. I'm not selling my kidneys so I can bet on the Super Bowl or anything. I also was in on cryptos pretty early and made enough money that I can make this gamble. I went all in on Ethereum around the time it was in the $10-15 range, hit it big and now I'm cashed in some of my profits to be a fucking degenerate.

I think all the people - even the well spoken ones, who profess that their coin of choice is undervalued don't really understand what their talking about. I think the entire market is a bubble but I'm willing to bet that this bubble and ride it to the moon or die trying. 

Strategy: Use Random.org's RNG to generate a number from 1-50 3 times and 51-100 once to pick the fourth coin. Reason why I did this is because I'm reasonably confident that if I got 4 really high numbers, I'd end up with 4 bullshit coins and lose the entire investment. I'm gambling but I'm not looking to purposely lose money. The only coins excluded from this was Tether and any coin I already had money in (Ethereum, Factom, OMG, QRL). Buy and hold for a year. See how I do. That's it.

The coins I picked ended up being:

* **Neo** - I've heard of this before. Used to be Antshares. That's all I know. Bought some today.
* **Ark** - Yo, this coin is pretty much made for holding, I picked it up and voted for a delegate already and I'm earning Ark!
* **Komodo** - This is basically another privacy coin but with smart contracts right? Dunno why people wouldn't just buy Monero over this but it's probably not terrible.
* And the 4th coin was....Nav Coin. I know nothing about it, will read up on it tomorrow.

Honestly, I'm glad I didn't get some shady sounding shit on the last one. I'll be back in a year (December 1st, 2018) to update you guys on my progress.

Now as for the logic behind this (aside from pure degeneracy), I'm gonna run the RNG again using 5 coins on the Top 100 again but from December of 2016.

Here's what I got:

* Ethereum Classic - $0.78 at the time, now $32.55
* Qwark - $0.02, now $0.16
* VeriCoin - $0.025, now $0.51
* Dnotes - $0.006, now $0.014
* Ripple - $0.0065, now $0.25

If you had bet $1000 on each coin back on December 2016, your portfolio would now be worth.....$119,194.86. Now it IS possible to pick ""good"" coins and probably beat that return, for example if you just threw $5000 into Ethereum instead in 2016, you'd have around $300,000 now. But that's not really the point of this exercise, I just wanna see if a literal dartboard could make money here. You guys can run this game of Crypto Roulette yourselves with your own RNG if you want. 

Or if you want, use an RNG from to pick 5 coins from the 2016 Top 100 and see how long it takes you to lose money.

The big risk here? Well, from 2015 to 2016, a good chunk of the Top 100 lost money. I'm basically banking on two things: The market continues to follow the general direction of Bitcoin and two, that this won't be another 2015. No shilling, no pretending I think all these coins are undervalued. Just throwing money at a board and seeing what works. ",107

Since email verification is used for performing withdraws, the hacker could not directly withdraw my money. The hacker used the web interface to do some very loss-making trading, against a second account doing the opposite, and making the profit.

I have exported the trades, and put them in a [graph](http://imgur.com/a/H9ylE).
One can see the very bad strategy: sell low, buy high...

I post my story for three reasons:

* Protect your account well! Use Two factor authentication! As lasy as I am, I didn't do this, too much hassle to grab your phone each time. Despite I don't know how they got my e-mail and password, this would have protected my account, and saved me $25.000!

* It's very instructive to see how fast you can lose money on a market with a shallow market depth.

* Try to get Poloniex handle my tickets. As we all know, Poloniex has a hard time handling the user requests. But it is important that Poloniex tracks the counter account making the profit. If the funds are still there, they need to get frozen.


PLEASE give this post up-votes to get some pressure on Poloniex to handle my tickets!

Response from poloniex

We have locked your Poloniex account and have reasons to believe your email address is compromised, please change its password and enable 2FA security on your email provider immediately, the attacker may be able to see this and try to lock you out - please act fast.

== Update ==
Response from poloniex

You are welcome. We have identified the accounts involved and they have been banned. Unfortunately, as is normally the case in these situations the attackers immediately withdrew the majority of the coins and as these transactions have now left our system and have been confirmed by the blockchain then they are outside our control. We will continue to investigate further and see if we are able to recover any of the coins that were not yet withdrawn.

I do get, that a lot of people entered the market to be millionaire in a fortnight like say CryptoNick or Trevon James (Yeah, these people have damaged the credibility of the millennials who invest in Crypto), but to be so salty as to call the entire space an outright scam is actually Self Denial. DYOR is the most ""stated"" and least ""used"" term in cryptocurrency. Rightfully, with just a bit of common sense, people wont even spend a penny on bitconnect.

I do agree that >1000 projects wont even come to fruition. But apart from a few, if we look at the top 50, well, I can say, atleast 20 of them are pretty massive projects. In an entirely new ecosystem, thats developing, even if we end up getting 10 projects that serve the world some good, would that not be awesome? 

The Bears are ruling the market, but they wont rule forever. The boom continued from November to say, mid January, and it seemed never ending. This too will end. 

Here I would try to lay down some of my opinions for all the doubts and FUD that media propagate:

1. NOT BACKED : Fiat, you will find is essentially backed by IMFs Currency Basket. The Currency Basket in itself is backed by Fiat. Thus, ultimately it pegs the whole concept of Fiat down to single entity, Trust. USD has major stronghold on the basket. This ultimately leads to a situation wherein the Currencies of other countries too, are to an extent pegged to USD, which we know is prone to whims of the FED.

Bitcoins underlying value is in the used Protocol. Bitcoin as such is just a protocol, using a distributed, decentralized ledger and a POW based consensus mechanism for its existence. Same for ethereum, the ether protocol. While people might argue, whats the REAL asset underlying , remember its the same logic used by Brick and Mortar shops against Amazon.

2. NOT GREEN : Lets calculate the entire energy spent by the Banking corporations, plus the energy consumption for Fiat printing, and the energy consumption for maintaining the security , and add to that the devaluation impact of fiat, and devise a parameter. Now lets compute the entire energy required for maintaining the Cryptosphere, and subtract the deflationary impact of a fixed total supply. I think Green Bankers will wet their pants in fear if such a study is conducted. 

If you hate POW, Crypto communities are working their ass out for POS, which if proven secure like POW, will end this debate forever.

3. High Transaction Fees and Lack of scalability : This is a problem. To have utmost  decentralization, low transaction fees, and high scalability all at the same time seems impossible. An optimum solution will be there. Probably we will have to do away some decentralization and security for purpose of efficiency. We are already seeing solutions like Nano, Cardano, Lightning Network. Its interesting  to find out where we end.

4. Terrorism : Bitcoin is used for Drugs and Terror Funding. Internet is used for Porn. Sound synonymous? You decide.

5. Lack of faith in the technology : When i see most of the cryptocurrency subs, its all about ""when will we break even"" Or ""Am selling all this since its going to zero"". Try speaking logic, they will spew Venom. As if buying Bitcoin at 20k dollars and keeping it in Bitconnect was the collective fault of the crypto community. Although am just over 7-8 months in this market, i can tell the only secret to make some money here, is your Conviction. Read the whitepaper, check the team, think about it, rate it. If you cant rate it DONT invest in it. Just like I dont keep Monero, simply because i fear regulatory crackdown might come hard on it. I might be completely wrong. But then, as long as you dont have the Conviction, you will end up losing. Always, yes always, dollar cost average while buying, and take profits, if you have doubled or tripled. Set the goalposts, and dont keep on changing them. Never buy all at a time. Never sell all at a time.  ",110

Hours later it still doesn't show up when I search by ""new"", and the mods ignored my private message asking why.  I think they are absolutely terrified of this possibility and that is the reason.  This question has been posted before, but the last discussion about it was over a year ago and I think it needs to be taken more seriously, as no clear answer has ever been given and no conclusions have been reached.  

What would happen if someone uploaded illegal content to the ETH blockchain such as child pornography? Wouldn't every single ETH miner and individual with a copy of the ETH blockchain thus be committing a felony? Would this be an effective way for someone to destroy/criminalize Ethereum?

I am under the impression that deleting things from the ETH blockchain would undermine its mission, has never been done, and is not currently possible without the majority of the miners agreeing to do so. How would the ETH community handle this, what would happen next?

The ETH creator's only response to this is that it would be too expensive to upload image files (UNTRUE, see my edit below), but for someone who just wanted to harm the ETH project I'm sure they would be willing to pay any price.  This is no excuse for not having a plan.  Somebody somewhere is going to do this, it's just a matter of time.  


The laws about this are extremely clear: ""Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and **electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal** visual depictions under federal law.""


EDIT: Just did some quick math and it costs about $250 to store 45 KB on the ETH blockchain.  This is way more than enough for a clear image or even several images.  What the ETH creator said about doing this being prohibitively expensive is total bullshit.  It's not a practical way to save your photos but there are countless black hats who just enjoy ruining things for everybody else, and $250 to throw a wrench in the ETH project would be a very small price for them.  

This image is 11.5 KB and would cost $65 to store on the ETH blockchain:  https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/56/2b/0c562b3a3cbf007072b45d35532d7250.jpg

Today’s Report (17th):

“Why is the market crashing?!”

I’ve had this as a headline more times than I can count in the last 48hrs. The answer to this question is both short and long. The short answer is this week we’ve seen a wallet hack which always creates fear in the crypto world. The reality a 3rd party may enter what you presumed to be a safe place and remove your valuable crypto creates hysteria within the crypto community, especially for newcomers. There have been 2 FUD attacks this week, one out of China and one out of South Korea. Both have been topics of previous posts so to keep it short and sweet: FUD attacks mean a dramatic correction in the market. Almost immediately once South Korea’s was dispelled, China’s was released not allowing any market recovery time. I also discussed whale consolidation. It is easy to go on KuCoin and see the whales at play openly shifting sell and buy walls when the orders approach allowing the price to fluctuate more dramatically, while also pushing it in a specific direction. This is easily visible on KuCoin with people using 5-10BTC. That is $50,000-$100,000. These whales are playing in KuCoin’s open waters with what most of us see as a good amount of money, but to real investors it is chump change.

This brings me to my new point for today. The December Option Contracts.

Anyone want to guess what day those December options expire in January? January 17th. Want to guess what side the majority of hedge fund guys bet on? If you saw BTC’s chart and were in the stock/commodity industry you’d be screaming SHORT. So we have a group of multi millionaire/billionaires trying to find out a way to cash out up against a BTC that was well above their option price (last week). If you are short you hope the price will decrease, if you are long you hope the price will increase. People who shorted BTC have until today to make it crash further. Cashing in on their short position while it’s under $10k and then using their profits to buy back in and actually go long on BTC for the short term because they know they just intentionally crashed the market and with a negative correction comes a positive one eventually.

We, even I, am a Plankton compared to the whales and sharks trading BTC futures on the CBOE and CME. I can try to predict market functions based on graphs and trends. I can attempt to find undervalued assets in a market full of scams and billion dollar coins. What I cannot do is control whales and sharks with 1000x the money I am investing openly manipulating the crypto markets the day options expire. People have been asking when will this market correction occur? The honest answer is no one knows. The reality is that we have conferences starting tomorrow, literally tomorrow. These continue through the weekend and continue through March. If I were a betting man, which I am, I would say the correction begins sometime tonight after option expiration or tomorrow pre-conference. This will lead into a bull run which will draw many new investors into the market similarly to what happened pre-Thanksgiving and the bull run we all experienced until just now.

BTC has had 5 price corrections since 2015. I’d include the graph/chart but it won’t let me, so I will try to explain it to you. The total negative correction period was between 5 and 35 days for all 5 events. That means as we are approaching 1 month in BTC’s price correction since it hit almost 20k we are about at the end of the statistical period BTC takes to correct. Each one of these corrections BTC saw a loss in value between 30% and 50%. The current correction we are in places BTC at almost a 50% loss. So we are at the parameters for length of time to correct, and correction amount. The final question, following these prior 4 corrections, how long did it take to attain a new ATH? How long will it be before my portfolio makes me look rich again!? The period for the past events was 8-55 days. Considering thus far BTC has mimicked all its trends to date, I expect it to take 8-55 days before we have a full recovery to a new ATH. Personally I expect it to be on the lower end of that range as I see the entire sector having exponentially more media exposure the next 3 months which should dramatically increase the value of BTC and alts. As the world is exposed and re-exposed to crypto the bull run should build steam. My prediction (that is all it is, a prediction) would be it takes approximately 3-4 weeks to reach a new ATH for BTC. With the $1 trillion market cap (for all of crypto) mark pierced long before May.

I’ve lost close to 30% this week. Most in the market lost much more than that! I highlighted opportunities like NEO, ICX and STRAT which were top gainers among many losers the past few days (even though almost everything dropped yesterday). Having a diversified portfolio between strong coins and moonshots helps weather any future storm. This has not been a fun correction for any of us. Please stop messaging me irate about market conditions. I cannot predict FUD, Hacks, or Dev team issues. I can try to predict when this turn around will occur (as early as tomorrow with option expiration and conferences starting). If you are that irate where you need to talk to someone or post a 6-page essay below feel free to call me: 800-273-8255 (Suicide Hotline). The crypto space has 50% market swings in 1 week. It also has 400% gains in following weeks. If you sell now you are giving those future gains to someone else. HOLD FAST KINGDOM.

This concludes the educational portion of today, if you’d like a topic reported on please let me know and I’d be happy to add it this week! I usually write a Daily Crypto Report that includes 1. Lessons (similar to above), 2. Safe Picks for January), 3. Conference Plays (from the above conferences), 4. Moonshot Explanations (multiple coins up over 400% in 2 weeks), and 5. ICOs! Feel free to follow me if you’d like to see today’s full report vs. just the educational lesson portion. If you have any topics you want explored please let me know!

(Favorites Remain ICX, STRAT, and NEO as Buy and Hold) My 3 favorite January SAFE plays remain ICX, STRAT, and NEO. NEO has more conferences than any other coin in the next 2 weeks and meetups all over Europe prior to that. NEO is the Asian Ether and should rapidly increase in value in the next 3 weeks. STRAT will remain a favorite of mine as they are launching their ICO Platform and have 2 flagship ICOs ready to be announced (they are timing the down market waiting for a correction, I guarantee it). The founder of STRAT also recently posted on his twitter regarding how exciting next week will be. The market correction is about to be over and there will be many new coins at the forefront of the financial revolution. The FUD started in South Korea and ICX crashed because of it. They still have their first HOSTED blockchain event during their mainnet release the last week of January in the tallest building in Seoul. All 3 make up a major portion of my “safe plays” for January with an expected return of 40-100%.

Everyone is always asking about which ICOs I’m involved in and recommend. If you want to know the ICOs or need referral links for Ku or Binance PM me :)",73

Let us gauge the sentiment,"I've seen a number of bubbles since the early 1980's. Baseball cards were my first experience with bubbles. I collected them because I liked them. Prices began to rise. Soon Wall Street bankers were buying them as speculative investments. They didn't really like them - they liked the money. Then U.S. real estate in late 80's. Then the DotCom bubble. The Internet was extremely interesting and had almost unlimited potential. Everyone could see it. Then the IPO's started and the valuations grew. Then all anyone saw was the money. I knew people that were mortgaging their house and taking the money and buying .com stocks of companies that had never made a dime (and never did). Then there was the Ferrari boom after that. Then the second U.S. real estate bubble in the early 2000's. The oil bubble. the U.S. Treasury bond bubble. There's the possible current bubble in stocks and real estate again right now. I guess I should throw in the six-pack abs advertising bubble as well. Wealth is created and destroyed over and over. Like in a casino, some win, most lose in the long run.

The focus on wealth, income and consumer lifestyle is so strong these days that people are like schools of fish that dart from one potential money making scheme to the next, always trying to be the first one in. The accessibility and efficiency of information on the internet make the school move far faster than it used too.

Crypto has followed the bubble path. As NT said above though ""Everyone knows it's a bubble. We still expect it to go higher."" There are so many variables involved it's basically impossible to even form a rational assumption as to what is going to happen though. The vast majority in these forums are far more interested in making money from the price appreciation of crypto than pursuing the original ideology behind it of destroying or damaging the legacy banking system or halting governments intrusion into privacy. That's unfortunate because that's what really gives crypto its value.

90% of the coins out there are useless. They have no value. They all use the same website templates, spout the same rhetoric and wild claims but haven't actually done anything and never will. Yet, millions of dollars are thrown at them eagerly. That is what always happens in bubbles. The ICO creators will spend that money. It will disappear and they still will not have done anything useful.

The infighting and cannibalization going on in the BTC/BCH/BTC2X arena is another sign. Bitcoin has grown big enough that now everyone wants to try to control it. You hear very little about BTC disrupting anything anymore (except maybe from A.Antonop). It's more about business, scalability, speculation etc. Well, the truth is that almost NO ONE uses crypto. NO ONE. As a percentage of all economic transactions that occur in a day, those involving crypto are essentially negligible. In fact, the dominant amount of volume is just speculators trading back and forth on exchanges. That's not economic adoption. It's just hopeful speculation. The general public just laughs at crypto right now and it probably won't change for some time, if ever. Not with 3 or 4 different versions of BTC fighting it out, 900 different crypto ponzi's running at any given time, and massive hacks or raids occurring on a weekly basis.

Any newbie trying to learn is going to have to navigate YouTube's plethora of less than honest propaganda pushing affiliate codes for Genesis, hashflare, bitconnect etc. If they do find valid instructive videos then they'll still have to wade through all the slop about BCH vs BTC vs BTC1 vs BTC2X etc.

As one who got into crytpo as an ideologue it's frustrating to watch. It's like supporting a presidential candidate because of their pre election speeches and then watching them get into office and do absolutely nothing of what they said they would do because they sell out at the first opportunity. That's basically every election here in the U.S. - on both sides. Crypto was a new realm where I thought I could avoid the hyperbole and rhetoric of politics. Maybe move away from the usual glacial speed of change in society and move toward something new and disruptive. But, alas, that may not be the case.

So, I believe we are in a bubble. The only question is whether it will be a fatal bubble or just a setback. Will it be a long term setback or short term from which the crypto space will recover quickly? I don't know. We'll find out soon enough I guess. A bubble popping will be good. It will purge the space of speculators that could care less about financial innovation and that school of fish will move on to something else. Then we can get back to disruption.

Proof of Stake (PoS) v3 is an improvement for all of the problems listed below.

###Centralization
Proof of Work (PoW) has always introduced points of centralization in the form of pools, electricity costs, and chip manufacturing.  Pool centralization on PoW is so common it’s hardly reported on anymore.  [Vertcoin is above 51%](https://www.reddit.com/r/vertcoin/comments/7ayjo7/move_from_coinotron_they_have_over_51_of_the_net/), [Zcoin is far above 51%](https://www.reddit.com/r/zcoin/comments/7cbq6e/to_the_entire_zcoin_mining_community_stop/), [Zcash is above 51%](https://themerkle.com/one-zcash-mining-pool-controls-over-51-of-the-network-hashrate/), [Dash has Antpool at 48%](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/#!extraction).  This is from looking at only 6 altcoins, not cherrypicking, so I’m sure there’s a lot more out there with this problem.  PoW relies on people voluntarily switching from large pools to avoid this risk, but clearly that does not work in practice.  Even if you get below 51%, you’re still at risk of the two or three largest pools being able to work together for an attack.  There’s more than enough money flying around to incentivize that type of action.

Electricity costs have centralized mining in places like China and Venezuela where it is significantly cheaper.  ASIC chip manufacturing has been the most popular point on this topic with BitMain being the focus for the past year.  The ASIC industry has centralized to only a few providers and in only a few countries.  This gives these companies significant control over all coins dependent on these ASICs for security.  
	
Now the ASIC Resistance fans are going to jump in here and say the chip part does not apply to them.  GPU mining introduces a few unique issues itself.  [This article about why Sia chose to make ASICs for their coin](https://blog.sia.tech/choosing-asics-for-sia-b318505b5b51) elaborates on these concerns, but I’m going to focus on one here.  ASICs are expensive and become obsolete quickly, but the are profitable if you are using them, so it is unlikely that there is much hashrate sitting idle.  Conversely, GPUs are abundant and a very small amount are dedicated to mining.  This means there is a massive amount of potential hashrate out there that could be used to attack a coin.  We’ve already seen this done with CPU miners with botnets and now browser background mining.  With the profitability of mining, the ease of operation (1 click miners anyone?), and the size of Mirai, Dridex, Reaper, and other botnets out there, you’ve got all the ingredients for a highly disruptive force.  

Proof of Stake has none of these issues.  It doesn’t rely on chips, electricity costs, or pools.  If you look at most PoS coin distributions for an idea of the hashrate, the largest player is usually less than 10% of the supply.  Buying 51% of the supply is massively more expensive than 51% of a PoW hashrate.  Additionally, some PoS coins like PIVX have a masternode layer as part of their block validation which would require ownership of far more than 51% of the supply for a chance at attack. 

###Governance

Centralization is not only a 51% attack concern because many coins rely on mining hashrate for governance, which further stresses the importance of a high quality, decentralized security mechanism.  If your proof mechanism has centralized in China, you’re not representing the interests of your users, you’re representing China’s interests.  If your chain has been attack by a botnet, you’re highly inflenced by the owner of the botnet’s C2 server.  Proof of Stake allows you to represent your users and scale influence according to investment.  This is better, but still can lead to plutocracy, so take a look at Decred or PIVX for some excellent work on governance improvements.

###Efficiency and Environmentally Friendliness
Proof of Stake is so low energy you can do it on a raspberry pi using a few watts.  Proof of Work however is tremendously wasteful, requiring a massive amount of energy, hardware, and usually investment amount.  Not only does this cut out many of the poorer people around the world, but an interesting story recently came out of Venezuela on this subject.  Due to the economic turmoil and subsidized electricity, many people have turned to mining crypto to make some money.  However, the oppressive government doesn’t like the loss of financial control or waste of electricity, so [they track down high electricity usage and jail crypto miners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4o0zz49IOY).  If they were staking a PoS coin and using network privacy tools, their risk would be basically eliminated.  



###“Rich get richer” fallacy
	
There is a belief floating around that staking is a rich get richer ponzi scheme type system.  This is not true in most PoS coins since coinage from PoSv1 was ditched.  

The main difference in mining/staking payout is who gets it. ASIC POW gives it to people who own mining or ASIC factories. Non-ASIC coins are giving it to the people with the technical knowledge and hardware to run mining rigs. Even 1 click miners are still giving it to people with the most optimized hardware. Proof of stake is simply giving it to the people holding the coin and supporting the network. It's a far more decentralized distribution. At a certain point POW is like broken window economics
	
Most POS3.0 coins give proportional rewards, they don't give a preference for the ultra rich like FUD implies.  When you consider that value is in relation to the coin supply, 8% ROI is just the same for 10 coins as 10,000,000 coins. Along the same lines a coin could just double everyone's holdings tomorrow and wealth distribution as a percentage would not change.
Inflation

The small nugget of truth in this type of issue is that a holder of over 51% of the coins is difficult or impossible to usurp, but this type of attack is prohibitively expensive on any somewhat mature coin.  It is magnitudes more expensive than buying more hashrate to attack a PoW coin and is not a repeatable attack because you would destroy the value of your own holdings and affect yourself more than the people you’re attacking.  With a PoW hashrate attack however, you haven’t lost much of anything and can easily move on to attack the next coin or mine for profit.

###Economics

Finally, I’ve seen several people support PoW because it creates work and provides jobs.  However, creating unneeded work just to employ someone is known in economics as [the Broken Window Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window).  

The efficiency of PoS also removes the need to collect fees for miners.  They can instead only be collected purely based on spam control and these savings are passed on to the users.  Conversely, PoW fees are already getting prohibitively expensive and as the reward drops miners will move to other, more profitable coins because fees will not sustain as much hashpower.  This will open up the coin to hashrate attacks. ",50

An Analysis.,"There are currently a lot of platforms, more specifically, there are 35 platforms within the Top100 only and many do very similar things. How is one supposed to know how they differ? That was the question that I asked myself.

So, I decided to compare all platforms within the Top100. I noticed that they can be put into into 5 different categories. Note: A platform is a cryptocurrency that offers smart contracts at least.

1. Dapps platforms \- 12
2. BaaS \- 11
3. Liquidity \- 2
4. Misc \- 7
5. Behemoths \-3

Here are all platforms in an excel spread sheet in their categories with a description: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8PHcNvvjuy848q18py\_CGcu8elRGQAUIf86EYh4QZo/edit#gid=268170779](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8PHcNvvjuy848q18py_CGcu8elRGQAUIf86EYh4QZo/edit#gid=268170779)

In order to find out which one is the best platform in each market currently and made sure to be strict with every platform and point out their flaws.

Let's look at the 5 markets.

# 1) Dapps platforms

Dapps platforms are definitely a solid bet for the next years. Besides Ethereum, Neo, EOS and Stellar are probably the most known here, however, all 4 are simply extremely centralized and would need to completely change their architecture to become more decentralized. Until that happens, none of these platform can really be considered as a platform with good technology, since everyone can achieve high scalability by letting a few hundred nodes do the consensus algorithm. There is nothing difficult about that. The difficulty is achieving several million TPS with 100,000 nodes deciding consensus.

Cardano, Aeternity are the only ones that seem to be able to maintain excellent decentralization with high scalability, because they scale through side\-chains/horizontally.

All platforms considered, Ethereum seems to be on the way there as well with its change to Casper.

1. Cardano has a great team, has probably the most secure PoS that was peer\-reviewed in a scientific approach, has their mainnet launched, has near infinite scalability through sidechains and offers broad usability of Smart contracts in a number of programming languages.
2. Ethereum is a 2nd generation blockchain that allows the use of smart contracts and dapps on a smaller scope. Ethereum currently has bad scalability, though this concern could be alleviated by the soon to be implemented Sharding concept and its new PoS/PoW consensus algorithm Casper. Still, there are platforms with much more comprehensive dapp ecosystems, and much more scalability. However, Ethereum just closed a partnership with AWS. This is probalby the biggest partnership in the cryptosphere. Though, in order to be better than any of the top 3 platforms, it would need to provide Oracles, a lot more functionality for dapps, partnerships, decentralized data storage, cloud computing.
3. Neblio is similar to NEO and a good platform, though it has a much smaller market cap.
4. EOS has high scalability, though is much more centralized than Skycoin, Elastos and Cardano. However, it offers a lot of functionality for Dapps. EOS is overhyped. It is on the same level as Neblio, Neo, Aeternity, but not on the same level as Skycoin, Elastos, IOTA, Cardano.
5. NEO is a very established platform in this category.However, Neo dapps scale on\-chain and can thus clog the network quickly. For that reason, NEO had to pick a very centralized approach to maintain scalability and it looking to rely on hand\-picked nodes to maintain scalability in the future, very similar to EOS also very centralized approach of 121 handpicked nodes.
6. Stellar has similar goals as Ripple, only that it is more a platform than only a currency, so it does offer more functionality. . Stellar uses Byzantine Fault Tolerance in the consensus protocol, which ensures secure consensus can be reached (moving the blockchain forward) even if a large percentage of nodes are disabled or acting dishonestly. It also helps keep nodes distributed. Stellar is a good platform with tight involvement with banks. While it doesn't have as much functionality as all above platforms, it can probably carve out its niche by doing really good business with banks.
7. Aeternity: We’ve seen recently, that it’s difficult to scale the execution of smart contracts on the blockchain. Crypto Kitties is a great example. Something as simple as creating and trading unique assets on Ethereum bogged the network down when transaction volume soared. Ethereum and Zilliqa address this problem with Sharding. Aeternity focuses on increasing the scalability of smart contracts and dapps by moving smart contracts off\-chain. Instead of running on the blockchain, smart contracts on Aeternity run in private state channels between the parties involved in the contracts. State channels are lines of communication between parties in a smart contract. They don’t touch the blockchain unless they need to for adjudication or transfer of value. Because they’re off\-chain, state channel contracts can operate much more efficiently. They don’t need to pay the network for every time they compute and can also operate with greater privacy. An important aspect of smart contract and dapp development is access to outside data sources. This could mean checking the weather in London, score of a football game, or price of gold. Oracles provide access to data hosted outside the blockchain. In many blockchain projects, oracles represent a security risk and potential point of failure, since they tend to be singular, centralized data streams. Aeternity proposes decentralizing oracles with their oracle machine. Doing so would make outside data immutable and unchangeable once it reaches Aeternity’s blockchain. Of course, the data source could still be hacked, so Aeternity implements a prediction market where users can bet on the accuracy and honesty of incoming data from various oracles.It also uses prediction markets for various voting and verification purposes within the platform. Aeternity’s network runs on on a hybrid of proof of work and proof of stake. Founded by a long\-time crypto\-enthusiast and early colleague of Vitalik Buterin, Yanislav Malahov.
8. IOST: To improve speed and scalability, IOStoken uses a Proof of Believability consensus mechanism eliminating the need for an energy\-hungry proof\-of\-work protocol, which stands as a barrier to blockchain scaling up for widespread adoption. With this system, a node is validated based on its past contributions and behaviors. Moreover, to increase fairness and to most fully embrace the decentralized nature of the blockchain, IOS uses a “fairness” algorithm that randomly distributes data to various nodes. It’s intended to support service\-oriented goods and services with large customer bases. Decentralized applications and smart contracts, the hallmarks of blockchain platforms, are a priority for IOS as well.
9. Request Network: Req payments can be used for online purchases, business to business invoices, escrow, advanced payments and eventually IoT payments between machines. Other than payments, the Request Network is also tackling auditing and budget transparency. Businesses have the ability to track invoices to audit payments as well as record transactions for accounting purposes. Governments, nonprofits, and other organizations can also use Request to bring transparency to their budget and expenditures.
10. Rchain: Similar to Ethereum with smart contracts, though much more scalable at an expected 40,000 TPS and possible 100,000 TPS. However, Rchain has not launched ye..
11. Ziliqa: Zilliqa is building a new way of sharding, so that 10,000 tps are soon possible by being linearly scalable with the number of nodes. That means, the more nodes, the faster the network gets. They are looking at implementing privacy as well.Rchain is an ok platform.
12. Ethereum classic is the original Ethereum that decided not to fork after a hack for philosophical reasons. The Ethereum that we know is its fork.

# 2) BaaS (Blockchain-as-a-Service)

BaaS take a different route to adoption than mere Dapps platforms. They are also dapp platforms, but focus on businesses (B2B) instead of end\-users (B2C) within the cryptosphere. They sell their blockchain services to companies, who then can build their own customizable blockchain as a side\-chain to the BaaS without hassle and worry about technology or blockchain architecture. This is all handled by the BaaS company already and the customer only needs to change a few variables and they have their own blockchain. Side\-chains are interesting, because they allow virtually infinite scaling, since there can be an infinite number of side\-chains that only communicate with the main\-chain occasionally and handle the majority of transactions on their own chain. This is also called horizontal scaling.

The success of a BaaS platform largely depends on its ability to close partnerships to sell to large businesses and having the best usability. The more contracts they can sell to businesses and institutions, the more valuable it will be. For that reason, the BaaS with the best ability to form partnerships and do sales will win this market. Technology isn't as important here. Of course, the platform has to work without bugs, but having a platform with outstanding technology, average usability and average marketing will lose against a platform with average technology, great usability and great marketing.

1. VeChain is a Singapore\-based project that’s building a business enterprise platform and inventory tracking system. . While it is not really competing with the above mentioned platforms, any of them can build supply management tools into their platform and compete with VeChain. However, VeChain has very strong partnerships. This gives them some protection of any of the above mentioned entering the market. Examples are verifying genuine luxury goods and food supply chains. VeChain has one of the strongest communities in the crypto world. If you are looking for something more high risk, high return, have a look into Ambrosus and Devery(Eve). Both also seem to be good at building partnerships, which is the most important characteristic for a supply chain platform required to succeed.
2. Icon is called the Korean Ethereum. However, it specializes more on building customizable blockchains for banks, insurance providers, hospitals, and universities, since it's a BaaS. Icon has a focus on on ID verification and payments. Icon is ery close behind Vechain, because with Samsung and Line.
3. WTC is a supply chain management platform, similar to Vechain, however, with fewer partnerships.
4. Komodo’s open\-source platform is for doing transparent, anonymous, private, and fungible transactions. They are then made ultra\-secure using Bitcoin’s blockchain via a Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) protocol and decentralized crowdfunding (ICO) platform to remove middlemen from project funding. Offers services for startups to create and manage their own Blockchains. While it doesn't have as many partnerships as other BaaS, it is the only BaaS that offers privacy so far. However, that's. it such a bug competitive advantage, since it can be replicated rather swiftly.
5. NEM: The NEM blockchain powers what they call the Smart Asset System. This system is intended to be an open, customizable blockchain solution for any number of use cases built on top of simple, powerful API calls. NEM started as a NXT fork and introduced a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Importance (PoI), designed to reward users’ contribution to the XEM community. It is roughly based on proof\-of\-stake, but it also reflects how active a user is in transacting with other users. POW rewards powerful computers and also requires excessive amounts of energy. POS gives an unfair advantage to coin hoarders. The more coins they keep in their accounts, the more they earn, meaning that the rich get richer and everyone has an incentive to save coins instead of spending them.
6. Ark is a fork of Lisk, which is doubling down on a smaller feature set than Lisk. Ark is a good BaaS, though it doesn't have many partnerships. Furthermore, they haven't launched their platform yet.
7. Dragonchain: The Purpose of DragonChain is to help companies quickly and easily incorporate blockchain into their business applications. Many companies might be interested in making this transition because of the benefits associated with serving clients over a blockchain – increased efficiency and security for transactions, a reduction of costs from eliminating potential fraud and scams, etc. Dragonchain is a good BaaS, though it doesn't have many partnerships. However, it was funded by Disney, so it might be able to get partnerships more easy.
8. LISK: Lisk's difference to other BaaS is that side chains are independent to the main chain and have to have their own nodes. Similar to neo whole allows dapps to deploy their blockchain too. Lisk is a good BaaS, though it doesn't have many partnerships. Furthermore, they haven't launched their platform yet.
9. Stratis: Different to LISK, Stratis will allow businesses and organizations to create their own blockchain according to their own needs, but secured on the parent Stratis chain. Stratis’s simple interface will allow organizations to quickly and easily deploy and/or test blockchain functionality of the Ethereum, BitShares, BitCoin, Lisk and Stratis environements.Stratis is similar to Lisk, but also doesn't have many partnerships
10. ARDR: Ardor is a public blockchain platform that will allow people to utilize the blockchain technology of Nxt through the use of child chains. A child chain, which is a ‘light’ blockchain that can be customized to a certain extent, is designed to allow easy self\-deploy for your own blockchain. Nxt claims that users will ""not need to worry"" about security, as that part is now handled by the main chain (Ardor). This is the chief innovation of Ardor. Ardor was evolved from NXT by the same company. NEM started as a NXT clone.
11. Bytom: Bytom is an interactive protocol of multiple financial assets ( digital currency, digital assets warrants, securities, dividends, bonds, intelligence information, forecasting information and other information that exist in the physical world) can be registered, exchanged, gambled and engaged in other more complicated and contract\-based interoperations via Bytom.

# 3) Liquidity

There are really only 2 platforms in the Liquidity market, albeit the Liquidity market could be one of the biggest markets with insitutional investors entering the cryptoworld soon, since there is very little liquidity in Bitcoin. For example, say a pension fund wants to buy or sell $10B in Bitcoins. No single exchange has that many Bitcoins available and it would wreak havoc on the market. This wouldn't be a problem with Liquidity platforms, since they pull all order books together and back up market liquidity with FIAT money among other things.

1. QASH is used to fuel its liquid platform which will be an exchange that will distribute their liquidity pool. Its product, the Worldbook is a multi\-exchange order book that matches crypto to crypto, and crypto to fiat and the reverse across all currencies. E.g., someone is selling Bitcoin is USD on exchange1 not owned by Quoine and someone is buying Bitcoin in EURO on exchange 2 not owned by Quoine. If the forex conversions and crypto conversions match then the trade will go through and the Worldbook will match it, it'll make the sale and the purchase on either exchange and each user will get what they wanted, which means exchanges with lower liquidity if they join the Worldbook will be able to fill orders and take trade fees they otherwise would miss out on.They turned it on to test it a few months ago for an hour or so and their exchange was the top exchange in the world by 4x volume for the day because all Worldbook trades ran through it. Binance wants BNB to be used on their one exchange. Qash wants their QASH token embedded in all of their partners. More info here [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8a8lnr/which\_are\_your\_top\_5\_favourite\_coins\_out\_of\_the/dwyjcbb/?context=3Qash](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8a8lnr/which_are_your_top_5_favourite_coins_out_of_the/dwyjcbb/?context=3Qash) is doing something completely different as the above mentioned. It offers liquidity in an illiquid market. Sell shovels during a gold rush.
2. Loopring is similar to Qash, only that it functions as a dezentralized exchange, while QASH is more of an API without a user interface. It is a protocol that will enable higher liquidity between exchanges and personal wallets by pooling all orders sent to its network and fill these orders through the order books of multiple exchanges. When using Loopring, traders never have to deposit funds into an exchange to begin trading. Even with decentralized exchanges like Ether Delta, IDex, or Bitshares, you’d have to deposit your funds onto the platform, usually via an Ethereum smart contract. But with Loopring, funds always remain in user wallets and are never locked by orders. This gives you complete autonomy over your funds while trading, allowing you to cancel, trim, or increase an order before it is executed.

# 4) Misc

These are platforms that are focused on a specialized functionality

1. Nebulas: Similar to how google indexes webpages Nebulas will index blockchain projects, smart contracts & data using the Nebulas rank algorithm that sifts & sorts the data. Developers rewarded NAS to develop & deploy on NAS chain. Nebulas calls this developer incentive protocol – basically rewards are issued based on how often dapp/contract etc. is used, the more the better the rewards and Proof of devotion. Works like DPoS except the best, most economically incentivised developers (Bookkeepers) get the forging spots. Ensuring brains stay with the project (Cross between PoI & PoS). 2,400 TPS\+, DAG used to solve the inter\-transaction dependencies in the PEE (Parallel Execution Environment) feature, first crypto Wallet that supports the Lightening Network.Nebulas is the only one doing what it's doing. This makes them very unique and a good investment.
2. Centrality is a decentralized market place for dapps that are all connected together on a blockchain\-powered system. Centrality aims to allow businesses to work together using blockchain technology. With Centrality, startups can collaborate through shared acquisition of customers, data, merchants, and content. That shared acquisition occurs across the Centrality blockchain, which hosts a number of decentralized apps called Scenes. Companies can use CENTRA tokens to purchase Scenes for their app, then leverage the power of the Centrality ecosystem to quickly scale. Some of Centrality's top dapps are, Skoot, a travel experience marketplace that consists of a virtual companion designed for free independent travelers and inbound visitors, Belong, a marketplace and an employee engagement platform that seems at helping business provide rewards for employees, Merge, a smart travel app that acts as a time management system, Ushare, a transports application that works across rental cars, public transport, taxi services, electric bikes and more. All of these dapps are able to communicate with each other and exchange data through Centrality. Centrality is the only one doing what it's doing. This makes them very unique and a good investment.
3. Salt: Leveraging blockchain assets to secure cash loans. Plans to offer cash loans in traditional currencies, backed by your cryptocurrency assets. Allows lenders worldwide to skip credit checks for easier access to affordable loans.Salt is a good lending platform. However, there is also Elixir, a better investment with a 30x smaller market cap, but also strong technology. Elixir has such a low market cap, because they didn't have an ICO and they only focused on development and no marketing. As of last week, they started marketing.
4. Aion: Today, there are hundreds of blockchains. In the coming years, those hundreds will become thousands and—with ,widespread adoption by mainstream business and government—millions. Blockchains don’t talk to each other at all right now, they are like the PCs of the 1980s. The Aion network is able to support custom blockchain architectures while still allowing for cross\-chain interoperability by enabling users to exchange data between any Aion\-compliant blockchains by making use of an interchain framework that allows for messages to be relayed between blockchains in a completely trust\-free manner.
5. Waves is a decentralized exchange and crowdfunding platform by letting companies and projects to issue and manage their own digital coin tokens to raise money.
6. ChainLink is a decentralized oracle service, the first of its kind. Oracles are defined as an ‘agent’ that finds and verifies real\-world occurrences and submits this information to a blockchain to be used in smart contracts.With ChainLink, smart contract users can use the network’s oracles to retrieve data from off\-chain application program interfaces (APIs), data pools, and other resources and integrate them into the blockchain and smart contracts. Basically, ChainLink takes information that is external to blockchain applications and puts it on\-chain. The difference to Aeternity is that Chainlink deploys the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Chainlink's main functionality is oracles, a functionality also offered by IOTA.
7. QTUM: Smart Contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. QTUM is a smart contracts for BTC, a very niche market. Furthermore, BTC might offer smart contracts itself soon and make QTUM obsolete. Hopefully QTUM will expand into more smart contracts functionality to become relevant again.

Nebulas with Indexing the Blockchain world and Salt with Lending are probably the 2 most interesting platforms here. Nebulas doesn't have a single competitor, though there are several competitors to Salt with a much smaller market cap and with similar development progress, ELIX.

# 5) Behemoths

There are 3 platforms that have not been discussed yet. However, they can do most what the above platforms can do and have the potential to steal the market of all above mentioned platforms. That's why I call them behemoths.

1.) Skycoin :Skycoin is building what Pied Piper is building in the series HBO's Silicon Valley, a completely decentralized internet that is not run by ISPs, but by IoT devices, making telecom providers like Comcast, ISPs who can control bandwith, cost, net neutrality, filters, access etc. obsolete and completely decentralize them. Skycoin offers what 36 coins are offering: 

1. 12 Scalable Currency (Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom)
2. 10 Smart Contract and Dapps platforms (Cardano, Ethereum, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Eth classic)
3. 10 BaaS (VeChain, Icon, WTC, Ontology, Komodo, NEM, Ark, Dragonchain, LISK, Stratis).
4. 4 Decentralized Storage (Siacoin, Maidsafe, Gybte, Storj)

If you think that the decentralized Internet will blow all other markets out of the water and will be the biggest invention of this decade, then Skycoin is your pick, because covers that and what 27 coins do.

2.) IOTA: With the launch of Q 1 week ago, IOTA is about to offer what 27 platforms within the Top 100 are offering (!) and they are probably looking to replace several more.

1. 12 Scalable Currency (Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom.)
2. 10 Smart Contract and Dapps platforms (Cardano, Ethereum, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Eth classic)
3. 2 Oracles (Aeternity, ChainLink)
4. 3 Outsourced Cloud Computing (DBC, Aelf, Golem)

IOTA is at the same level as Skycoin and Elastos. However, SKY's flagship product is the Decentralized Internet and ELA's is the most comprehensive dapps operating system in the cryptosphere, which IOTA cannot really replicate in the near future, because it takes years of reseach and development. This protects ELA and SKY from IOTA for now. 

However, it looks like IOTA can snatch up all the smaller, easier to replicate markets, such as cloud computing, oracles, smart contracts, decentralized storage, currency exchange and soon possibly also supply chain management, BaaS functionality, privacy, security identification since none of those are really hard to build. However, Skycoin and Elastos will probably focus on their flagships and leave IOTA to scoop up all the rest. It will be an interesting year.

3.) Elastos started out as a mobile operating system 18 years ago and has now moved towards a smart contracts platform, operating system and a runtime environment for Dapps. Thanks to side\-chains they are near infinitely scalable and is thus also very decentralized. Elastos is offering what 36 coins are offering

1. 12 Scalable Currency (Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom.)
2. 10 Smart Contract and Dapps platforms (Cardano, Ethereum, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Eth classic)
3. 10 BaaS (VeChain, Icon, WTC, Ontology, Komodo, NEM, Ark, Dragonchain, LISK, Stratis).
4. 4 Decentralized Storage (Siacoin, Maidsafe, Gybte, Storj)

If you are very convinced that BaaS solutions and dapps platforms will be the big winners for 2018, then Elastos is your pick as far as I can see, because it is probably the best BaaS and dapps platform with near infinite scalability and the best decentralization and thus does what 32 coins do.

3 Closing Questions

All of the above findings leave me with those 3 questions. What are your thoughts?

1. Why invest in any of Dapps platforms (Cardano, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Aeternity, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Ethereum, Eth classic) when Elastos and Skycoin do everything they do, are much more decentralized and scalable through side\-chain/off\-chain/horizontal scaling and offer lots more functionality beyond that?
2. Why invest in any BaaS (Ontology, Komodo, NEM, Ark ,Dragonchain, LISK, Stratis, ARDR) if ICX and VeChain offer everything what all of the above offer and already have 10x more partnerships than their competitors?
3. It looks like out of all 35 platforms, only 5 are really strong: IOTA, Skycoin, Elastos, VeChain, ICX. While the first 3 seem to cover already almost half of the top 100, the last 2 really convince in the partnership department. What's the argument for investing in any of the 30 other platforms? Maybe that they can specialise on a specific feature set, however, is this really a convincing argument? The cryptoworld is harsh and if you can't keep up with competition, you'll be moved out of the market quickly.",116

Bitcoin now costs the same as it did the day after Thanksgiving.  Ethereum costs the same as it did on Jan 2.  Neo is currently twice as much as it was Dec 21.  Monero is at 233 and it never broke 200 until this past December.  Cardano is now right where it was in mid December.  It's too bad people are glued to their hourly account balance and missing out on the big picture.  Emotionally distraught people are selling.  Financially wise people are buying.  This summer, there is going to be alot of bitter folks that wish they never logged into their accounts on Feb 1 2018. Countries around the world are not banning crypto.  They are simply cleaning things up and gearing up for full blown legal crypto.  Sure, there will be new rules but crypto is here to stay.  If tomorrow marked the final day of cryptocurrency history, I could understand the panic and the selling.  However, do you think the Canadian gov't would be using Ethereum for record keeping if crypto was in trouble?  Would IBM be partnering with Stellar if crypto was doomed?  Would Microsoft be sponsoring NEO dev competitions if crypto was ending?  Would Samsung be pouring big money into building and selling cryptocurrency mining chips if Crypto was truly in trouble?  Politicians are pumping the breaks until they figure out how to cash in.  They did they same thing with daily fantasy sports, online poker, gambling, and cannabis.  In 2015, Daily Fantasy Sports was legal in 45 states.  In 2016, it was legal in only 10 states because politicians wanted to shut it down until they figured out how to make money off it for themselves.  Today, DFS is legal in 41 states.  That's right, from an unregulated 45 (2015), cracked down to 10 (2016), and now that politicians can make money off the regulated industry, it's legal in 41.  Folks, crypto is going through the growing pains of becoming a full blown accepted industry. Check out online poker...

- 1995: The first online poker websites appear.  Everyone made money except governments.

- 1999:  Republican from Virginia, Robert Goodlatte, tried to shut it down with a new law.  People panicked and cashed out.  His law never passed.  It was defeated.

- 2003:  Thanks to pressure from the Justice Department, most banks blocked customers from sending money to poker sites

- 2005:  The world's largest online poker site (PartyGaming) went live on the London Stock exchange the same year that a Republican from Iowa tried to ban credit card payments on gambling sites.  His bill never reached the Senate floor.

- 2006:  Goodlatte is back again.  Tries to ban online poker/gambling.  He is defeated again.

- 2006:  President Bush signs the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, banning the transfer of money to gambling sites.  Everyone cashes out.

Today:  New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware have legalized it.  People in every state freely use offshore sites.  Banks are no longer blocking payments.

Whether it's online poker, cannabis, daily fantasy sports, or cryptocurrency, the people vote with their wallets.  Sure, governments always get involved so they can make a buck too (if it was about our safety, health, and well being then guns would be outlawed).  Hold your coins if you haven't sold.  Buy coins this weekend at a massive discount.  Embrace the future.  Expect dips along the way.  We are riding a climate change graph that continually trends up.  So what if there is a record cold winter here or there.  The zig-zagging line is trending up from year to year.  Hold and/or buy.  You will have major profits should you choose to sell this summer, fall, or in 2019.  Keep your eye on the prize, stay off reddit, stay away from ""news"", and trust your instincts when you realized months or years ago that this was an unstoppable revolution: the future.

Seriously? Then how do the multi billion dollar scams happen? Or is it just that political foul play is LEGAL? Or is it just the loss of control over financial system? 

""The guy shining your shoes."" I hope you get what your opinion stands for. 

Yesterday I already wrote in a post that we are in a full scale war mode, and these executives of these corrupt houses won't mind stooping as low as they want for maintaining their control. We will have false news, false reports, increased propaganda.

 While most believe that institutional money will enter the system to bring formalization to the system, I believe otherwise. They will do their pretty f**king best to either kill the system or to get decentralization and distributed nature out of the system.

Next time, you call bitcoin a scam or any legit project a scam, think twice. Atleast I would prefer to be accountable for losing/making my own money rather than be controlled by corrupt houses, who would tell me what I should and what I shouldn't

I found this article in the beginning of August containing the most interesting coins to invest in.
http://itsblockchain.com/2017/07/31/top-8-altcoins-to-invest-in-august/

Of course, I was curious how it would develop and monitored this coins closely. Followed a few of them, and made nice money with CVC and Lisk. 
Because this article was such a success, yesterday 'itsblockain.com' posted their new article and I thought it would be interesting to know the opinion of you guys. 
http://itsblockchain.com/2017/08/29/top-10-altcoins-to-invest-in-september/
Was it luck in August ? There is not a lot of info in the first article, but after some research the coins were pretty interesting. Will the top 10 coins indeed go up (some of them up to x4)? 

Please share your thoughts!
