Fuck these guys, and make sure you spread the word around about what they did, and continue to do with other Ponzi's like cloud mining. Go to their videos, and websites, and spread the warning.

These people don't get to just conveniently forget what has happened, and expect the rest of us to just forget about it too! Fuck them, and hopefully some more serious actions get taken against them for what they are responsible for, and please do your research before getting involved with any of these shysters too people. 

You have a responsibility to protect yourself and your friends as well, and you are not exempt of all blame here either for falling for this shit if you did, so wake the fuck up!

**Edit**

Since this post blew up, and made its way on over to the /r/All sub-Reddit and most of them don't understand what is going on, I decided to make an edit with a video that pretty much sums up all of the bad actors and more mentioned in this post, so if you want a backstory, just watch this video from /u/dougpolkpoker for a better understanding: https://youtu.be/upPmNzcqFkU",3032

How prices work, and what moves them - and it's not money invested/withdrawn.","/edit: Hi /r/all. While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race. If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave. 

Please consider reading up on Permaculture, sustainable living, Forest gardening, Backyard Chickens, etc. Consider following what I did and do it for yourself. [This all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/U79bql-JSqI)

[Bored for a night? Go watch ""Sustainable"" on Netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) 

Look into people like [Geoff Lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), Mark Shepard, Sepp Holzer, these people are going to save us. 

Want to make a small change yourself? Grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. Reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. Want to do something bigger? Plant a fruit tree in your backyard. Maybe two. Maybe a raspberry bush. You are now part of saving the human race.

If everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.

While you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.

You can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.

Do it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjBLVSo0zeY) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. Go learn how, let me show you how. If you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree.

Original post starts below. I apologize for the shilling of Permaculture, but I think loss of topsoil will impact us all if we don't reverse it soon. We need soil, we need bees, we need food. We need to stop buying December Bananas in Canada. We need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.

**I also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

**AN EXAMPLE**

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing"".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing ""Bubble"", ""Scam"", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

We've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of January, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. 

#What's happening now and how bad will it get?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all you should realize that there is a [January Dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid January](https://i.imgur.com/VXEHw0W.png). This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.

Different theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the ""January Effect"" that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:

1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs

2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year

While this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:

* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)

* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)

* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)

* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down

* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses

* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.

So in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). We don't know how bad it will get or what the future will bring, but as of right now we shouldn't be in a bear market yet.

**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**

If you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. 

The other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.

**What should long term investors do?**

For long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit. 

Essentially revaluate your positions and trim your position sizes if you don't feel comfortable with the losses.

#How to construct your portfolio going forward
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling.
 

**Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Memes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). 

There is no ideal or ""correct"" methodology but I can outline mine:

**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**

Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. 

* Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like ""Web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? 

* Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?


**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**

I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:

* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?

* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?

* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?

* What current product exists?

* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?

* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?



**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** 

I have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.

Once you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a ""dividend"" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.

The benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).

If you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do

* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. 

* Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

* If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. 

Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.

Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how ""smart money"" does it.

**Think about your portfolio allocation**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. 

For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.

You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc

* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etc

You should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.

**Think of your ""circle of competence""**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? 

This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


**Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.


#Summing it up

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.

Basically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.

Take care and have fun investing :)

**Edit March 2018**: Lol looking back I'm regretting starting the title with ""Why we won't have a long term bear market"" now, I was more karma whoring with that catchy title than anything. We recovered up to 11K from this post, but then crashed again hard later in February-March because of a slew of reasons from Tether subpeona to unforseen regulatory issues.",913

3. When asked if Crypto has any ""intrinsic value""? - There is an intrinsic value and relation of the value of bitcoin and the cost of mining it. 

4. Price of Bitcoin is just one publicly traded company like McDonalds. In comparison, global money supply is 7.6T. And since Bitcoin has been compared to digital gold, value of all gold in the world is 8T.


5. HOLY SHT.. He just mentioned ""HODL"". Hahaha - According to him its ""Hold on for dear life"".

""We owe it to this new generation, to respect their interest in this new technology with a thoughtful regulatory approach.""

Though the SEC chair addressed that there was not much they could do, but are working with Feds and the treasury. 

- ""illegal transactions"" was discussed, and the steps taken to combat misuse of crypto.

This subreddit above all else is supposed to be a hub of news, useful discourse, information, and understanding of cryptocurrencies/crypto assets in general. Through it I've found some amazing coins and made investments that I would have never known to make.

But that's only because I didn't listen to the trash level sentiment being carried out and the hardcore tribalism that causes people to lose out on good, solid investments. So here, lemme break this into 3 categories:

**FOR THE INVESTORS**

It has become incredibly clear to me that FAR too large of a portion of our reader base on this sub is entirely unaware of the fundamentals of investing in new tech. This is not a sports team, this is not some TV show or fad, THIS IS A BRAND FUCKING NEW ASSET CLASS THAT CAN REVOLUTIONIZE OUR SOCIETY. And it is MUCH too early to be acting like we've already made our correct bets and that nothing can happen to change the trajectory of our favorite project.

1) How is the TECH/Whitepaper? (this should always be your FIRST question)

2) How is the Dev Team?

3) Do they have a funding scheme? What kind? (community donation, venture capital, institutional investment/buyouts, ICO etc.)

4) How are they organized?

5) How is their track record?

6) Do they have any institutional or prolific backing?

7) Does it solve a goddamn problem or alleviate friction anywhere?

8) Does it have competition and where does it stand within that?

9) How close to ready is it?

10) Any plans to create, stimulate, and maintain adoption?

11) Does it have a Marketing and media presence? A good one?

12) How is its Mainstream visibility?

13) How about Accesibility and Liquidity?

14) Growth potential based on current price and supply

15) Can it survive or at least get around the regulatory hammer?

Regardless of what you think your coin's shit smells like, these are the things you need to know in order to decide where the hell you're putting your money. Because each and every single one of these questions is important in determining the value potential and sustainability of your coin. If you actually care about making money then you'll shed your need to be on a single team and diversify your assets based on the fundamentals. Yes, I know a month feels like an entire year in crypto, but investment is NORMALLY supposed to be a multi-decade affair. Meanwhile longterm for most of us means 2022 at the latest. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

**FOR THE DAY TRADERS**

In general, you have a very simple job. Look at graphs, do some TA, make a plan, invest based on that and do your best to have orders and trading set up that minimizes risk. So just do that. I don't want to hear a single one of you coming through a subreddit and moaning about how you think something is a shitcoin because it wasn't volatile enough that day to make you dumb amounts of money. No one is saying you aren't making hella money or that you aren't right from a daytrading perspective, but keep that to the trading subreddits where other like-minded people are actually impatient enough to care about that. You should understand that when you put up some pissy comment like that, new investors who haven't the faintest clue on anything will take what you say seriously and model their money movement around your words.

Think about that.

If I had listened to day traders, as a mid-long term investor, I'd have missed out on NEO (back when it was Antshares), ICX, and XRP. I would have missed out on the following percentage gains:

NEO: 1150% Gains as of now
ICX: 5080% Gains as of now
XRP: 1720% Gains as of now

^Why would I want to miss out on that because of impatience and bad philosophy?

**FOR THE SUPPORTERS**

For people who are genuinely in this for philosophy, that's great, discuss the merits of your philosophy and vision and why you think the coin aligns with that. Otherwise:

SHUT THE FUCK UP.

If you don't, you'll start spreading FUD and lies, it's inevitable, the second you decide to trash another coin you're going to do it as a way to feel superior regardless of how good or shitty your investment is.

I'm done.",362
37,CryptoCurrency,6949,7wlo19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7wlo19/the_bitgrail_hack_was_months_ago_bomber_defrauded/,Rezzz8080,2018-02-10 17:19:56,"The Bitgrail hack was months ago, bomber defrauded new users of their assets to pay off old users. This is a criminal act. We need to contact the EU/Italian authorities & make sure he's punished.","Let's be clear here Francesco Firano (/u/TheBomber9) is a criminal. The hack was in November which means that he's been insolvent for months & has been defrauding new users out of their money to keep the exchange afloat. Once the Binance listing was imminent he locked all the exchange's assets. His actions show clear intent. If his exchange was hacked & he immediately reported it to the police, he'd just be incompetent but by hiding this from new users he transitioned from moron to criminal. 

This is the US legal definition of Fraud:

* Fraud. A false representation of a matter of fact—whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, **or by concealment of what should have been disclosed**—that deceives and is intended to deceive another so that the individual will act upon it to her or his legal injury.

[In order to be convicted of fraud in the US, the following must be proved:](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fraud)

>Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: 

> * (1) a false statement of a material fact,

>* (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, 

>* (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, 

>* (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and 

>* (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result.

Now I'm not a lawyer but it seems to me that he is clearly guilty & convictable. It's likely the EU/Italian definition is the same since fraud is a universal crime. [He may also be guilty of running a ponzi scheme](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ponzi_scheme)

We need to make sure people don't get away with this sort of thing. I don't want to say he's destroyed people's lives because there is almost always a way to recover but he has certainly severely damaged peoples wellbeing. 

I'm in the US but if someone in the EU/Italy could contact the authorities & let them know about the situation maybe we can get a little bit of justice for his victims. I don't trust him at all when he said he has reported this to authorities, it's **very likely he completely misrepresented the situation to them** even if he did (which is also a crime).

If you live in the USA & are a victim please call the FBI to file a report. Apparently extradition is possible between the USA & Italy. If there is enough outcry about this situation maybe we can get the wheels turning.

Edit: [He's also guilty of embezzlement](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embezzlement )

> Elements common to embezzlement are as follows: (1) the property must belong to a person other than the accused, such as an employer or principal; (2) the property must be converted subsequent to the defendant's original and lawful possession of it; (3) the defendant must be in a position of trust, so that the property is held by him or her pursuant to some fiduciary duty; and (4) the defendant must have an intent to defraud the owner at the time of the conversion.

Edit: Evidence he knew about the hack (personally I think it's borderline impossible for him not to realize he's missing over 3/4ths of the XRB in his wallet but here's some hard evidence anyways).

Here is a comprehensive guide on how to invest and prosper over the long term.,"Well its happened, the crypto market just experienced the worst crash since 2014, the bubble has burst. [The idiocy of newbies FOMO-ing into anything with low nominal value lead to endless twitter timelines like this](https://i.imgur.com/zDjmRjl.jpg), and now nobody has any idea where the market settles. What do you do now? 

In the following weeks it will be a good time to rethink your investment approach and how you arrive at your decisions. Just buying whatever is shilled on Twitter or Reddit and jumping from one crypto to another isn't going to work like it did these last two months. 

The good news is that we're finally back closer and closer to our long term moving average which is much more healthy for entrants, the bad news is that the fear might continue compounding if outstanding issues are not dealt with. [Tether is the big concern for me personally for reasons I've stated many times](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7tg8fn/tether_drama_tether_has_dissolved_relationship/dtco50g/), but some relief in the short term may come if the SEC and CFTC meeting on February 6th goes well. Nobody really knows where the bottom is but I think we're now past the ""irrational exhuberance"" stage and we're entering a period of more serious inspection where cryptos will actually have to prove themselves as useful. I suspect hype artists like CryptoNick and John McAfee will fall out of favor.

But perhaps most importantly use this as a learning experience, don't try to point fingers now. The type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was rewarded in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a shillcoin, following hype..etc) could only ever lead to what we are experiencing now. Just like so many people jumped on the crypto bandwagon during the bull run, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon is to be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble. Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case will accept that they themselves with their own investing behavior were the real reason for the gross overvaluation of most cryptocurrencies, and the inevitable crash.

So if you're looking for a fresh start after the massacre (or just want to get in now), here is a guide:

#Part A: Making a Investment Strategy
---------------------------

This is your money, put some effort into investing it with an actual strategy. Some simple yet essential advice that should apply to everyone, regardless of individual strategy:

1. Slow down and research each crypto that you're buying for at least a week.

2. Don't buy something just because it has risen.

3. Don't exit a position just because it has declined.

4. Invest only as much as you can afford to lose.

5. Prepare enter and exit strategies in advance. 

First take some time to think about your ROI target, set your hold periods for each position and how much you are actually ready to risk losing.

**ROI targets**

A lot of young investors who are in crypto have unrealistic expectations about returns and risk. A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 5-10% ROI in a month to be unexciting. 

But its important to temper your hype and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year and how unlikely it is that we see 10x returns in the next year. What we saw recently was [Greater Fool Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) in action. Those unexciting returns of 5-10% a month are much more of the norm, and much more healthy for an alternative investment class. 

You can think about setting a target in terms of the market ROI over a relevant holding period and then add or decrease based on your own risk profile.

**Example: Calculating a 2 year ROI target**

Lets say you want to hold for 2 years now, how could you set a realistic target to strive for? You could look at a historical 2 year return as a base, preferably during a period similar to what we're facing now. Now that we had a major correction, I think we can look at the two year period starting in 2015 after we had the 2014 crash. To calculate a 2 year CAGR starting in 2015:

Year  | Total Crypto Market Cap 
-------|------
Jan 1, 2015:|  $5.5 billion 
Jan 1, 2017:  | $18 billion

Compounded annual growth return (CAGR):  [(18/5.5)^(1/2)]-1 = 81%

This annual return rate of 81% comes out to about 4.9% compounded monthly. This may not sound exciting to the lambo moon crowd, but it will keep you grounded in reality. You can aim for a higher return (say 2x of that 81% rate) if you choose to take on more risky propositions. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. 

Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio based on your target.

**Risk Management**

Everything you buy in crypto is risky, but it still helps to think of these 3 risk categories:

* Core holdings - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. The Coinbase pairs (Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum) are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero.

* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have a working product and niche, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash and Ripple, relatively established history but still uncertainty over long term viability.

* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, ICOs, low caps, shillcoins...etc. Most cryptos are in this category.

How much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation for one, but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. 

The general starting point I would recommend is: 

* 50-70% for newbies in Low Risk Core, then you can go down to 30% as you gains confidence and experience

* Always try to keep at least a 1/3rd in safe core positions

* Don't go all in on speculative picks.

Some more core principles on risk management to consider:

* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. 

* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.

* Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.

* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.

* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing mode.

* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback. This should be part of your entry strategy.

* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.


You can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm), but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).

Rt = Rm +Ri

The market risk is something you cannot avoid, it is essentially the risk that is carried by the entire market over things like regulations. What you can minimize though the Ri, the specific risks with your crypto. That will depend on the team composition, geographic risks (for example Chinese coins like NEO carry regulatory risks specific to China), competition within the space and likelihood of adoption and other factors, which I'll describe in Part 2: Crypto Picking Methodology.


**Portfolio Allocation**

Along with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment - VeChain, Walton, Factom...etc

* Promising Tech segment - NANO/Raiblock, Cardano...etc

Think about your [""Circle of Competence""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence), your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Your ability to properly judge risk and potential is going to largely correlated to your understanding of the subject matter. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? If you don't understand anything about the tech when you read the Cardano paper, are you really able to determine how likely it is to be adopted?

Consider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. 

You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you have over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


#Part B: Crypto Picking Methodology (Due Dilligence)
------------------------------------------

Do you struggle on how to fundamentally analyze cryptocurrencies? Here is a 3-step methodology to follow to perform your due dilligence:

# Step 1: Filtering and Research

There is so much out there that you can get overwhelmed. The best way to start is to think back to your own portfolio allocation strategy and what you would like to get more off. For example in my view enterprise-focused blockchain solutions will be important in the next few years, and so I look to create a list of various cryptos that are in that segment.

[Upfolio has brief descriptions of the top 100 cryptos and is filterable by categories](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained), for example you can click the ""Enterprise"" category and you have a neat list of VEN, FCT, WTC...etc.

Once you have a list of potential candidates, its time to read about them:

* Critically evaluate the website. If it's a cocktail of nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and poorly made, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. 

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts selling? Try to figure out who the whales are (not always easy!) and what the foundation/founder account is based on the initial allocation.

* Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?

* Search out the subreddit and look at a few Medium or Steem blogs about the coin. How ""shilly"" is the community, and how much engagement is there between developer and the community?

* I would also go through the BitcoinTalk thread and Twitter mentions, judge both the length and quality of the discussion.

You can actually filter out a lot of scams and bad investments by simply keeping your eye out on the following red flags:

* allocations that give way too much to the founder

* guaranteed promises of returns (Bitcooonnneeeect!)

* vague whitepapers filled with buzzwords

* vague timelines and no clear use case

* Github with no useful code and sparse activity

* a team that is difficult to find information on 

#Step 2: Passing a potential pick through a checklist

Once you feel fairly confident that a pick is worth analyzing further, run them through a standardized checklist of questions. This is one I use, you can add other questions yourself:

Crypto Analysis Checklist |
---------|
What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve? |
What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized? |
How big is the market they're targeting? |
Who is their competition and what does it do better? |
What is the roadmap they created and how well have they kept to it? |
What current product exists? |
How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional? |
Is there any new tech, and is it informational or governance based? |
Can it be easily copied? |
What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?  |

The last question is the most important. 

This is where the riskiness of your crypto is evaluated, the Ri I talked about above. Here you should be able to accurate place the crypto into one of the three risk categories. I also like to run through this checklist of blockchain benefits and consider which specific properties of the blockchain are being used by the specific crypto to provide some increased utility over the current transactional method:

Benefits of Cryptocurrency |
---------|
Decentralization - no need for a third party to agree or validate transactions. |
Transparency and trust - As blockchain are shared, everyone can see what transactions occur. Useful for something like an online casino. |
Immutability - It is extremely difficult to change a transaction once its been put onto a blockchain |
Distributed availability - The system is spread on thousands of nodes on a P2P network, so its difficult to take the system down. |
Security - cryptographically secured transactions provide integrity |
Simplification and consolidation - a blockchain can serve as a shared ledger in industries where multiple entities previously kept their own data sources |
Quicker Settlement - In the financial industry when we're dealing with post-trade settlement, a blockchain can drastically increase the speed of verification |
Cost - in some cases avoiding a third party verification would drastically reduce costs. |


#Step 3: Create a valuation model

You don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:

**Probablistic Scenario Valuation**

This is all about thinking of scenarios and probability, a helpful exercise in itself. For example: Bill Miller, a prominent value investor, [wrote a probabilistic valuation case for Bitcoin in 2015](http://dev.lmminvestments.com/a-value-investors-case-for-bitcoin/). He looked at two possible scenarios for probabalistic valuation:

1. becoming a store-of-value equal to gold (a $6.4 trillion value), with a .25% probability of occurring
2.  replacing payment processors like VISA, MasterCard, etc. (a $350 million dollar value) with a 2.5% probability

Combining those scenarios would give you the total expected market cap: (0.25% x 6.4 trillion) + (2.5% x 350 million). Divide this by the outstanding supply and you have your valuation.


**Metcalfe's Law**

[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. We can alter this to crypto by thinking about it in terms of both users and transactions:

For example, compare the Coinbase pairs:

Metric | Bitoin | Ethereum  | Litecoin
---------|----------|----------|----------
Market Cap | $152 Billion | $93 Billion | $7.3 Billion
Daily Transactions (last 24hrs) | 249,851| 1,051,427 | 70,397
Active Addresses (Peak 1Yr) | 1,132,000 |1,035,000 | 514,000
Metcalfe Ratio (Transactions Based)| 2.43 | 0.08 | 1.47
Metcalfe Ratio (Address Based)| 0.12| 0.09 | 0.03

Generally the higher the ratio, the higher the valuation given for each address/transaction.

**Market Cap to Industry comparisons**

Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

**More complex valuation models**

If you would like to get into more fleshed out models with Excel, I highly recommend Chris Burniske's blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an [equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto](https://medium.com/@cburniske).

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done by Nodar Janashia using Chris' model ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit). 

You should create multiple scenarios with multiple assumptions, both positive and negative. Have a base scenario and then moderately optimistic/pessimistic and highly optimistic/pessimistic scenario.

Personally I like to see at least a 50% upward potential before investing from my moderately pessimistic scenario, but you can set your own safety margin.

The real beneficial thing about modelling isn't even the price or valuation comparisons it spits out, but that it forces you to think about why the coin has value and what your own assumption about the future are. For example the discount rate you apply to the net present utility formula drastically affects the valuation, and it reflects your own assumptions of how risky the crypto is. What exactly would be a reasonable discount rate? What about the digital economy you are assuming for the coin, what levers affects its size and adoption and how likely are your assumptions to come true? You'll be a drastically more intelligent investor if you think about the fundamental variables that give your coin the market cap you think it should hold.


#Summing it up
------------------------------------------

The time for lambo psychosis is over. But that's no reason to feel down, this is a new day and what many were waiting for. I've put together in one place here how to construct a portfolio allocation (taking into consideration risk and return targets), and how to go through a systematic crypto picking method. I'm won't tell you what to buy, you should always decide that for yourself and DYOR. But as long as you follow a rational and thorough methodology (feel free to modify anything I said above to suit your own needs) you will feel pretty good about your investments, even in times like these.

These days you're probably stupid not to have money invested in crypto, but just keep in mind that it's almost entirely based on speculation, and a lot of your success is based on pure luck. **Everybody is a genius investor in a bull market**.

This is not the first time in history when a generation of young people have jumped on a wild speculation train and gotten rich. During the height of the dotcom bubble, people had the exact same attitudes. ""25% returns in a year? Those are scrub numbers. Anything less than 100% is unacceptable!"" We all know how that ride ended, and this ride shall too come to an end. Whether it ends in a major bust, or it becomes a mainstream financial tool dominated by Wall Street, this ride will come to an end. Enjoy the great returns while you can.

Credit is predatory by nature. The bank doesn't care when you max your card out on alcohol, designer clothes, gambling, or any other worthless and risky commodity. Your bank doesn't give one single tiny little shit about you in any way beyond your capacity to generate revenue. You are a revenue generating unit and nothing more, end of story. They are building artificial barriers to crypto because they view it as a direct and fundamental threat to their industries... and with good reason, because it is. The reality is anyone who invests wisely in crypto right now is going to make a significant ROI over the next few years, opening up the opportunity to pay off large balances, which decreases the revenue they earn from interest. This is nothing more than a desperate attempt at self preservation. 

Again I would encourage anyone who has their bank or credit card company create a barrier for them to purchase crypto, to immediately end doing business with that institution and make sure they know why. If my bank halts my purchases, I'll liquidate my account and close it the same day. Same goes with my credit cards, they will get cut up and never used again. DON'T bend over for them.

I was going to reply in a comment, but I feel that a lot of people can benefit from a short write-up on them.

#What is a sell wall?

A sell wall is a tool used by a rich individual,or group of rich individuals, to manipulate the price of a stock downwards. A large sell order is set at a specific price by the whale(s) to prevent higher sell orders from executing.

A sell wall looks like this on the depth chart: http://brettwestbrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-12.58.10-PM.png

###How does it work?

This is best explained as an example.

A wealthy person, we will call him Richard, tells a group of his wealthy friends that he wants to make money on a particular stock. This could be for a number of reasons such as:

* The stock has a lot of room to grow
* The stock can be easily manipulated
* The stock has a lot of potential to get big in the near future

Richard and his friends decide that it's a good idea. They all want 1 million of X cryptocurrency. *Unfortunately, in the cryptocurrency market Richard and his friends can't execute all the buy orders at once or the prices will skyrocket!* 


To achieve 1 million obtained goal, they decide to set up a sell wall, and manipulate the price downwards. They do this in steps:

1. They accumulate together. They will maybe get 250,000 of X crypto each. In their specific market, this didn't affect the price that much. Great! 

2. They now set a specific price they feel is low enough for them to be able to reach their 1m X crypto goal. For this particular crypto they decide to all sell their obtained crypto at $2.40.

3. Now, between Richard and the group, there is >1 million dollars worth of X crypto selling for @2.40 on the market, a seemingly undervalued price.There is SO much volume being sold now, buying pressure cannot eat through that wall in a reasonable time frame - it would take a very high buying pressure to do so. 

What also happens next is the key: nobody else can sell above that sell wall price until it's gone. The result? People need to sell lower than the sell wall in order to liquefy their stock. This drives the price downwards.

Richard and his friends can now safey all get to their 1m X crypto mark without raising the price exponentially! When they decide to rid their sell walls the price moves up accordingly!

##How can you use this to your advantage?

A common thought is that the main goal of a sell wall is to instill fear into the weaker hands so that they sell by the thought that ""Oh no everyone is selling!!"" While it's not the main purpose, it probably does happen a little bit. People get nervous when things a large volume of crypto is being sold.

As Warren Buffet said: *Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.*

For a real life example:

VECHAIN. 

For those that don't know, about a month ago vechain was sitting around 29 cents. They had a pretty large announcement that was, yes, front page of reddit. The price nearly doubled to 70 cents (it actually happened right before the announcement). 

What happened after? Some people bought the rumor and sold the news. But, this news was really big. Masternodes, rebranding, big partnerships. Ask any VEN holder why the price didn't continue to rise after that and they will probably know why - price manipulation with sell walls.

Such as: https://i.redd.it/bjaubsgn04601.png

VECHAIN has had a lot of new partnerships, announcements, and generally great news to propel the crypto further, but has been held back by these sells walls constantly. Just recently buying pressure has been very high and the whales have been having trouble controlling it they way they would like.

That's a real example of what has been happening. Take a look at roadmaps and see where different projects are at in development. Are any projects getting seemingly great news without moving in price?

What about REQ? We saw a couple of front page posts about REQ moving to main net, quality pictures from the UI, etc etc. REQ was fairly stagnant around 30 cents before slingshotting to 80 cents in nearly a day. Sell walls and price manipulation.This field is speculative so any news drives buying pressure. Unfortunately, the very wealthy have a say as well. 

Look for great projects and determine if they solve a need. Look to see what's hitting the media's spot light, such as the front page here. **THEN take a look at the depth charts on the exchanges.** In crypto anything goes, and you better believe the very wealthy have difficult to obtain knowledge. When you see these obvious sell walls, you want to investigate and try to identify any trends. 

Perhaps you can look at **volume** of a cryptocurrency. A stagnant crypto with LOTS of volume is a huge indicator, sideways consolidation. Ripple did this for a few weeks, even months at certain stages. 

Once you find one that looks good - **you'll need to hold at the mercy of the whales.** Trust me, they want profit more than you do. The wait is almost always worth it because price will rise very rapidly once selling pressure is completely abolished.


Hope this helps guys.

Today, VeChain Foundation hosted the rebrand event showcasing the consortium chain VeChain to the public blockchain VeChainThor. This event was an invite-only occasion for media and partners with a live stream to YouTube. During the event, Sunny Lu and Luca Crisciotti of DNV GL talked about the past, present, and future of VeChain. 

Sunny clarified that VeChain's uniqueness is not only technical but also its understanding of ecosystems. He pointed to the governance and economic models as examples. This sentiment was echoed by Luca as he assured everyone that after meeting with countless blockchain solution representatives he chose VeChain as the partner for DNV GL because of their understanding and dedication to the customer. 

This mindset has lead to over 180 opportunities for VeChain in 2018. Many of these opportunities are left unannounced, but in the course of the event, VeChain announced several new partners and opportunities including the University of Oxford Mathematical Institute, Carbon Bank solutions, BitOcean ICO, food sourcing, and BMW Group. 

Also in this event, Sunny Lu showcased three decentralized applications (DApps) that are being built to cater towards the mainnet launch. Those DApps include:

* VeVID -  KYC and digital ID maintenance solution that can be native to all VeChain applications or partners. [You can read the official announcement here.](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechains-first-official-public-infrastructural-decentralized-application-vevid-cd97bdf98670) 

* VeVOT - A voting service that will be initially used by the VeChain governance model. This solution will be available for other general voting events to be logged on the blockchain such as government voting and board votes. Voting results will be audited by independent partners and certified on the blockchain. 

* VeSCC - Smart contracts on the VeChainThor mainnet can be categorized into certified and uncertified, which can be checked in the explorer. The certification of smart contracts covers various aspects including the identity of the owner, the legality of the purpose, and the security of the source code. 

At the event, the carbon bank solution was made public to raise awareness that VeChain is building solutions alongside DNV GL that will monitor, analyze, and reduce the carbon footprint. This solution is being used and researched by universities (Tsinghua University), businesses, and government bodies.

In this event Sunny Lu took the time to introduce the University of Oxford (Mathematical Institute) as a partner in the VeChain ecosystem and will be working on assuring the economic model is working as intended for VET holders, VeThor users, and new customers. It was also mentioned that Japanese FSA certified partner BitOcean would be the first ICO on VeChainThor.

Luca Crisciotti left with words of encouragement of VeChain “We are not talking about pilot projects, we are talking about solutions that are working for real cases.” Luca went on to say:“DNV GL is a company with over 150 years of history. And unfortunately, this is something we can not share, because you [VeChain] were only born a few months ago. But we do have something in common, and it's a bright future. So thank you Sunny for the partnership and this amazing event.”

It's far worse, 333230 XRPs!!!!","I saw a text of Bittrex user who suffering missing deposit on BITTREX.
My case is more delayed and severe.

Nine days ago, i made a transaction from Coinone to Bittrex Exchange.
But there is no deposit in my Bittrex wallet and no pending deposit.

Bittrex Exchange do not solve my problem for 9 days. They do not properly respond to me on twitter, facebook messenger, and support tickets. They replied only automated texts.

The account explorer shows its perfectly correct. But i cant find my 333230 XRPs, worth more than 300000 USD. What can I do? For 9 days, I just click and click refresh button every seconds. 

It's all about my money. Why this terrible situation happen in my life. It's a nightmare. Someone cheers me XRP price elevating. But i dont have that XRP, now.

Frankly speaking, I feel some psychotic problem. When i see price up, i feel manic. But when i see my empty wallet, i feel depressed. It has repeated 9 days. I lost my weight 4kgs for 9days.
My mental health is extremely worsening.

A transfer from an external wallet/platform to GDAX appeared in all of our Coinbase accounts, and then said that it transferred successfully to our GDAX accounts, but then never showed up in our GDAX accounts. So it would appear our money is gone, because our balances are zero.  We’ve all opened tickets with support with absolutely no responses, posted on their subreddit, and called to only be on hold for hours without any help. I really don’t know what else to do except try to get us on the front page of a bigger crypto community.

More details about this issue are here https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/7mx88o/urgent_coinbase_to_gdax_transfer_disappeared/?st=JBUBPP35&sh=a19f1463

Thank you so much for your help to anybody who can spare an upvote to bring some attention to this.

If anybody from Coinbase finally wants to help, my support ticket number is 3221822

UPDATE: there’s a comment response from the Coinbase CEO, saying they’ll get to our tickets. Since I doubt they’ll respond again to me (and my balance is still 0 on GDAX so basically this whole issue was still not enough to fix our problem) - here’s my response:

What proof do I have that my coins are not lost? My balance on GDAX is 0, and my LTC balance on Coinbase is 0. This kind of thing should be a priority issue if people are getting balances of 0 on GDAX with an automatic send to their wallet transfer from Coinbase to GDAX like this. I’m even more frustrated that with 3.5k upvotes and a response, my LTC balance is still 0 from an error on their side.

One last clarification: I do not have any pending transfer issues (these I’m familiar with an have learned to wait). The transaction on the blockchain finished, the funds even appeared in my Coinbase account. The automatic transfer from Coinbase to GDAX (which has happened at least 5-10 times with no issues for me) this time withdrew the money from my Coinbase account and said the deposit to GDAX was completed. But my balance is 0 for LTC on Coinbase and 0 on GDAX, so this last move to GDAX (which is supposed to be instant, and says completed) zeroed my LTC balance. My balance has been 0 LTC for over 3 days now. This has nothing to do with their wire transfers, although I really feel for everyone still waiting on their withdrawals and hope they resolve that soon.

UPDATE: it’s been 4 days and still missing all of my LTC

UPDATE: 5 days now. No more holidays. I have no faith in crypto exchanges anymore.

6 days now. What a joke. I’ll post the next update in 6 months when my support ticket gets addressed and if I’m lucky they’ll fix our problem.

FINAL UPDATE: Fixed finally after 6 and a half days.  My account has been transferred the litecoin that were missing, thank you so much everyone on reddit for bringing attention to this. I really owe everyone because I had no power at all over this situation and I like to think this post helped get Coinbase to at least address this issue. It would appear others are still having problems with this Coinbase to GDAX transfer, or at least haven’t had their missing coins returned yet, just as an FYI.

From what I see this is happening now : 

1. CMC removed Korean exchanges
2. Prices/graphs instantly tanked (but in practice not relevant to people outside Korea who dont trade there anyhow)
3. Large number of people did not recognize what actually happened and that there were not moves/selling on their western exchanges
4. Those same people are now dumping large amount of coins trying to ""cut loses"" because of the false impression that coin is crashing.
5. Random stuff happening

My opinion is that this should have been handled much better by CMC. At least put a banner saying ""WE HAVE EXCLUDED KOREAN EXCHANGES BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT AND IT WILL HAVE SUCH INFLUENCE ON CALCULATIONS"". I just hope they do not put back and remove those exchanges at random point in time. Any thoughts?",1068

Here’s a reminder for y’all lurkers here or a wake up call for people who actually take the time of day to shitpost:

1. Nobody who’s even close to being a big player or is knowledgeable about the market is wasting their time on fucking r/cryptocurrency 

2. Most “advice” you get on here is from hodlboys or plain shills trying to jerk their own dicks by echoing the same copy paste moon statements. By the occasional mercy of god there’s a post that makes life worth living but those are usually rare. This post is also not one of them.

3. No you won’t get rich hodling a mass shilled top 100 coin for a week, a month, maybe a year. Jesus Christ if it took early bitcoin miners years to go from a couple hundred to almost 20k you won’t make it with a short term focus.

4. Putting a couple hundred or thousand dollars does not make you an “investor” or at all knowledgeable about blockchain. Losing your money sucks learn from mistakes instead of dragging others down. 

5. Comments that say “3k next it’s over boys” with 30 upvotes does NOT legitimize that claim, assume it’s 31 idiots sharing a herd mentality with no basis for their arbitrary prediction.

6. Anything that has to do with price on r/cryptocurrency should not be taken as financial advice. Nobody on this sub actually know which way the markets will turn, TA works in very niche circumstances and cannot predict movements based around obvious facts or fundamental trends.

That’s all I have to say for now, my fingers are tired. I’ve been in the space for some years now and this sub is a place I frequent despite all the cancerous shit I see daily. The memes are fucking comedy gold and I will always love you guys for being here with me.

TL;DR do your own fucking research and don’t listen to anyone announcing the direction this market is heading.

EDIT: Some people apparently are not seeing the point of this post or get some kind of joy mocking if. Allow me to make some things clear:

No I’m not angry or have any personal salt nor am I projecting my expectations of what this sub SHOULD be but rather I’m only letting people know what this sub IS at the moment and what to be wary for. I was once new to the space and foolishly trusted the advice stemming from fickle sentiments and made mistakes doing so. All I hope to achieve with this post is for people to realize that this is not the place for accurate predictions regarding market movement and to be careful, That’s all.

EDIT 2: Thanks for gold. It is currently too difficult to respond to the sheer volume of comments thus I am unable to  answer every new question that gets posted, sorry.",440

That's not to say you shouldn't take some of your hard earned money, do your research and get involved.  This community is amazing, dynamic and there's a ton of potential to make great returns.  However, high risk investment should never be your whole portfolio.  It should be the smallest part.

Make sure that you're setting aside money in a Roth IRA, contributing to your 401k, Vanguard funds, etc.  The boring stuff.  The stuff that grows slowly over a lifetime.  Don't just diversify your coins, diversify your whole portfolio.  It's something I certainly wish I'd tackled at a much younger age.  Believe me, you'll thank me later.  ",941

Its taken a long time but finally gone down below that.

You've probably heard many people tell you it would eventually happen back in December 2017 and to reduce expose to crypto [(including me)](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7l7k9i/daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017/drl2esi/), but when you're hyped up on 20% gains every week its hard to be cautious or engage in defensive measures. To many the last quarter of 2017 and into early 2018 was like a beach party with coke and Victoria Secret models. Who wants to listen to someone tell you about how you're gonna crash hard with a headache the next morning?

With this latest crash, Bitcoin's price is back to roughly mid October 2017, which is roughly when the mainstream mania started. Many on this sub entered after October 2017 and hence are now left holding heavy bags. Many are down 80% or even 90%.  Here is the current losses from ATH for the top cryptos:

Asset | Loss from ATH
-- | --
BTC | -77%
XRP | - 88%
ETH | -90%
BCH | -95%
XLM | -79%
EOS | -83%
LTC | -91%
ADA | -96%
XMR | -85%
TRN | -96%

**Who do we blame?**
--------------------------------------------------

At a time like this its easy to get angry, to look at someone to blame. Whether Roger Ver and the hash wars, whether BAAKT delay, whether whales or SEC or institutions, everyone has their favorite boogeyman. No one thing is the reason why the market is down 80%. 

The reality is that Bitcoin (and all other crypto by extension) was ovevalued even by grossly overoptimistic measures. Its not BAKKT or the whales trying to get your coins for cheap. The same people who were buying at near peak bubble thinking they were getting into the chance of a lifetime are prone to look for someone to blame for their losses, when it was actually their fault for buying near the end of a mania. 

Nobody wants to admit that it was their own greed, lack of research and irrational behavior that lead to the gross overvaluation of all cryptocurrency.

**Is it over yet?**
--------------------------------------------------

The $6K consolidation was likely a result of the market coiling tighter and tighter around the mining breakeven point for some of the smaller miners. The big firms in China are profitable mining below 6K, but many smaller ones in the US and Europe aren't. You can actually [see the total hash rate going down](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate). Once it broke it was a big fall straight down. 

Bitcoin is mined at 12.5 BTC. per block at 10 minute blocks, which comes out to around 1800 BTC every day. This 1800 BTC has to be absorbed by every day, which means the following at different price levels:

Price Level | Daily net buying needed to absorb mined coins
---|---
6000 | $10.8 million/day
4500 | $8.1 million/day
3000 | $5.4 million/day

At the current price, at least theoretically $8.4 million in demand is needed to cover the mining output. Of course the miners don't immediately dump it all, but it shows why miners have an incentive to keep the price high and try to incite FOMO with a BGD. 

I can also see that after this latest drop, the ""buy the dip"" sentiment had substantially gone down, at least compared to the other fast drops in price. This is especially discouraging those who were waiting for the ""November bull run"", which never came. Its clear to more people now that this probably isn't just downward correction that will reverse, but a multiyear bear market. This is why the bounce has been so weak compared to earlier in the year. Compare that to the last two big 2 day drops:

* March 29 - April 1st (drop from 8K to 6K): Within 2 days it bounced back up to 7.5K

* June 22-24 (drop from 6.8K to 5.8K): Within 2 days it bounced back to 6.3K

The weakness of this current bounce says it all, people are no longer optimistic that BAKKT or ETF or any other catalyst will lead to a bull run that they can cash out quick. It may be a period of stagnation followed by further drops as big holders take profits.

I also think that the FED tightening with rate hikes is leading to a lot more volatility not only in stocks, but crypto as well. Right now asset deflation seems to be a global macro risk as cheap credit dries up, and Bitcoin surely isn't immune from this.

My personal view is that at this point we may see further declines, but calling what's going to happen next is always dangerous. A whale (especially a big mining operation) with a series of large orders to clear out the order book on Bitfinex could give us a BGD out of nowhere at any time and take us back to 6K, it would be interesting to see how the market reacts to something like that. But I'm not betting on it leading to any sustained rally past 10K. Quite the opposite.

---------------------------------------------------

So what's a crypto shrimp to do? I'll split my thoughts into two, for those who are still in the green and those in the loss.

**If you're still in the green**
--------------------------------------------------


If you're still in profit, this is a great time to consider how much more downward selling you can take and also how you can hedge downward risk.

If you're someone who purchased when Bitcoin was below $1000, you should [calculate your compounded annual ROI](https://financial-calculators.com/roi-calculator) and decide if that return is good enough for you. For equities, the long term average is about 10% per year, 20-30% in a good bull market. 

Its your decision, but taking out profits that exceed principal and reinvesting the principal is not at all a bad idea. For those who invested before Bitcoin reached $1K (April 2017) the current price is still an insane return that no other asset class can match.

Another important thing is to think about how you can hedge the risk of downward movement. This is where derivative exchanges are very useful, although you do need to do some research on how derivatives work and how to not get liquidated. If you have substantial holdings, the effort to learn this is worth it. 

The basic idea is that you can buy short contracts that increase in value as Bitcoin goes down, proportional to the amount of leverage you put to finance the contract. If managed correctly, you can protect your entire stack with a portion as leverage. Its something commonly done by miners, who short Bitcoin with derivatives to hedge their holdings.

**If you're in the loss**
--------------------------------------------------


The untold reality is that HODL is a meme told to newbies to prevent panic selling during a downturn while the smart money cashes out in a more orderly fashion. But does that mean you shouldn't hold if you're already down massively? 

Well that depends on your own life situation, how much you've invested, and if you don't need the money for the next few years.

Mathematically, whether it drops to 4.5K or 3K from the reference of 6K is highly meaningful, its a drop of 25% or 50%. But if your reference starting point is much higher, then it really doesn't matter all that much. A drop from 17K to 4.5K is a 74% loss while down to 3K it would be 82%, massive losses either way. In that sense if this is money you don't need, it makes sense to simply have it stored in a wallet and forget about it for a few years. Who cares if it drops further after a certain point if you don't plan to take it out for a while? Its like in equities markets where people with massive losses don't sell, but instead move the loss position into their retirement fund where they don't plan to take it out for a long time and thus are giving it time to rebound back.

But what if its money you need? What if like many out there you took out loans hoping to catch a run to 50K? If you have high interest debt (credit cards...etc), focus on paying that down first. Credit cards generally have high interest and many compound daily, so pay down the debt first rather than trying to pay your debts off with a crypto bull run that may take years to materialize.

This is also a good learning opportunity. It is worrying how few people who hold crypto have a clue what any of this even is or how it works. [I've always recommended this video to explain how Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) actually work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).

A good thing to do during catastrophic losses is to honestly access why you got suckered into buying high in the first place. Most people here are young, and this is a valuable lesson in why you shouldn't follow the herd.  Everyone is a genius in a bull market, everyone is chasing the next hype. Crypto tends to attract people looking for a get-rich-quick-without-effort crowd, but it takes some mental effort to understand this beyond the buzzwords. Take the time to understand the fundamental reasons why an asset has value and what factors would drive its rise once the hype dies down. What makes Bitcoin valuable, what makes some of the other cryptoassets valuable? If those fundamentals in some way changes, so should your opinion. 

Its also a great opportunity to help in its adoption by using it. The irony of it all is that people demand that they get rich because of the hard work of buying a bunch of crypto in an exchange and transferring it to their wallet, without any understanding what they're buying into. 

Also don't be angry. Don't look to blame. Look to learn and improve next time you invest.

2. Shortly after the announcement Hedge Fund Managers along with the wealthy elite start buying up BTC by the billions in order to drive price up to ATH (19k) with the knowledge of knowing they would short the 1st BPOE future.
2. First Future Market set at 15k
3. Hedge Fund Managers start laddering sales of their now ATH BTCs making BILLIONS.
4. These large sales slowly create panic and more people start selling. By this time The hedge funds guys are close to cashed out.
6. Market takes a dump and the Hedge Funds Made Billions buying BTC Low and selling high while at the same time NAILING their short call on Future Market.

OK GREAT HEIST RIGHT?  BUT WAIT THATS NOT ALL.

7. Hedge Funds Managers and Wealthy Elite go LONG on BCME Future which is due 10 days after the first futures call.
8. Market takes a complete nose dive back to 9k and gues who is their to start buying again?  Thats right the Hedge Fund Managers and Wealthy Elite.
9. With their newly made BILLIONS the Hedge Fund Managers push the price back up over course of 7 days in order to hit their LONG CALL on 2nd Futures market.

If you see a spike in the price of BTC and overall market cap after 1pm PST today (when 1st future call settles) you will have witnessed one of the greatest robberies of ALL TIME.

Due to the amount of notice crypto has been getting lately with 50 cent’s accidental millions and Katy Perry’s crypto-nails, a lot of people are thinking this is the perfect time to make a major push for adoption. There’s currently a huge problem with people who don’t own coins, a lot of them agree that they’re not invested because it’s “fake” money with no actual use. So, we as crypto-owners want to **demand** the right to use the gains we’ve made to purchase real goods.

Now, we’re starting the hashtag #PayWithCrypto. We’re demanding our favorite companies like amazon, eBay, Walmart, etc, to let us pay with cryptocurrency!

All it takes is a simple tweet like “Hey @Amazon, I want to #PayWithCrypto” to show companies we are serious about this. I would appreciate the upvotes to help us get the word out and show the world how serious the community is about worldwide adoption of crypto!",506

*Decentralized?
Bitmain and a small group of big miners control mining in almost all ASIC minable coins. NiceHash offers criminals the ability to attack smaller coins attempting to have more decentralized gpu mining. Non minable coins by their creation aren't decentralized. Sorry they may not be scams but they are definitely not decentralized

*Leaders in the community acting like wallstreet dicks? 
I have to read Charlie praising Tapjets a company that rents fucking private jets, for their crypto payment implementation. Ver doesn't need explaining.  The rest going to NYC and partying at $2000 a head conventions.....Da fuck?

*Rampant market manipulation?
Ok crypto may have been built on this but its blatantly systematic now! The hope of institutional money coming in was to help legitimize crypto markets..... foreseeable backfire there.

*Community that values ""the tech"" over lambos?
Many from the early community cashed out during the boom and were replaced by get rich hopers. Trying to have a conversation with some people on something thats wrong besides Charts and Price is getting harder and harder.

Edit: so this post blew up, I want to clarify few things :

- I clearly highlighted to them the risks and rewards of investing and the best investment is to invest in the tech of the coin by doing the right research first, that doesn't matter though since all they are seeing is the price NOW and all coins are down now. 
- I explicitly told them to avoid some scam coins such as bitconnect (and they did so thats good) but again it doesn't matter now since everything is down, the scam coins with the good coins. 
- No I don't expect people to thank me for introducing them to crypto, I only mentioned this part to highlight how they only remembered me when the market dipped. 
- I learned the lesson the hard way, so fuck me sideways if I ever try to talk about crypto to anyone else IRL again 
- Yes I believe the whole market will bounce back soon, do your own research on why crypto was created in the first place. 
- I won't recommend any coins here in this post because the point of this post is not shilling, please do your own research and decide 
- Remember, you only lose / profit when sell, all the numbers you see in your portfolio apps are just that, numbers. 


Original Post:

Mid November I started talking about crypto with my family and friends and gave them a little ""push"" to start investing small amounts to experiment... I wanted them to make some money because I know they could really use it and I explained how volatile the market rn and the rewards and risk they would have to take and strongly advised them to never ever invest what they can't afford to lose

Some of them got really invested and saw some big gains and started to show off their percentage gains on social media (which is stupid but whatever). 

Noone really thanked me for introducing them to crypto when they made some big gains, they all acted like they got into it because they were smart (before I introduced them to crypto they thought bitcoin was a physical golden coin and can't be bought in fraction), but again whatever I didn't do it for people to thank me I just wanted them to make some money because I know they needed some. 

Fast forward to today morning and FUCK.MY.LIFE I opened my phone and I find a barrage of messages from them accusing me of scamming them and tricking them into crypto because they lost money, I tried to explain to them that this is normal and it will bounce back soon and it's just a correction and don't sell but they aren't listening most of them sold and ""cut their loses"" before the ""bubble burst"".

I am never going to talk about crypto with anyone in real life again, fuck em I am not getting involved in this shitty situation ever again",880

Before Kucoin was added as an exchange, I played around day trading on bitgrail to see if I could gain some more Nano. Turned out to be (probably) one of the worst decisions of my life. I've decided that the only way to deal with this is to move on as quickly as possible and keep making solid decisions. Negative emotions in times like these serve no one. I will continue to invest in cryptocurrency to the degree that I believe it has potential, and if it does, the worst decision I can make right now is stopping. I will be much, much more careful with exchanges in the future.

Bitgrail's statement on the hack can be found, here:
https://bitgrail.com/news

I've been trying to withdraw for a month, but their 10 BTC/day limit screwed me. I was verified quite early and had to pull out small amounts at a time for a very long time. Eventually, their 10 BTC/day limit tended toward something like 1 BTC, and my support tickets weren't answered.

Essentially the worker there told me that it's their policy that they don't allow cryptocurrency activity and that I wouldn't be allowed to open an account with them unless I guaranteed that I wouldn't be doing that. 

I asked to speak to the branch manager, not expecting to change their mind on the decision but more for an explanation. and she told me it's a huge fraud risk and money laundering issue for them and for that reason they have been taking action against accounts that have activity from exchanges.

Hearing this I went on a mini rant about how exchanges have started following KYC and AML regulations, crypto is a technical marvel, blah blah blah, pretty much no different than the shilling that goes on here.

Apparently she was so impressed that she asked for my contact details and now she wants me do to a 15 minute talk + Q&A session with her and her colleagues discussing cryptocurrency. I actually said yes cause I saw an opportunity for a job down the line lol but here lies my problem. 

Clearly I know more than her about it but I definitely don't know enough about crypto to do a detailed talk and feel confident answering questions. I'm only a year 2 finance student IDK jack shit about anything in this industry. 

Please help me prepare talking points or show me resources I can use to get a more in depth knowledge on this so I don't look like a jackass talking about moons and lambos lmfao

After countless hours of research on the various industries being disrupted, after reading whitepapers, parsing through the profile of team members, watching recorded conferences and making calculations based on demand and market size, I can write with full confidence that the overwhelming majority of the community of crypto investors is retarded. Never have I seen a market that is less focused on growth objectives, or that circlejerks harder to news and announcements whose impact they don't even try to measure or fully understand.

In all honesty, it's not *that* surprising. The tech itself is more or less difficult to understand (anyone with an engineering, computer science, economics or finance background *should* be able to grasp the underlying concepts and realize why distributed ledgers have vale, despite not being familiar with every key concept) but the extremely hard part is picturing exactly how efficiencies are bound to be created on an industrial level, and how impactful they will be. In other markets, this is why there exist ratings, panels of experts, consulting groups. They perpetually gauge the health of various industries and make predictions based on trends, to help others make informed decisions. Even then, a layer of speculation (and thus, manipulation) always exists, but the ratio of speculation vs. real demand tends to be in a different league entirely.

Despite knowing or suspecting this, however, the same shit happens **every time** here. Bitcoin starts to drop, and the trolls come out of the woods to spread their depressive thoughts onto everyone else. Altcoins start to shine, and the morons who bought during the frenzy and are seeing 10% gains for the first time in weeks, months, if not ever, start tugging each other and patting themselves in the back and writing essays as to why DPoS experiment #898 (which doesn't even have a main net yet) is on track to being massively adopted and is *definitely* the best buy opportunity of the decade. Bitcoin starts to rise again, and suddenly all money floods from the rest of the market to feed Big Daddy and every single other project is a shitcoin again and they'll never amount to anything ever.

It is beyond frustrating to see how easily everyone is being manipulated. Short-term fluctuations in the market doesn't make you right, and it doesn't make you wrong either. There are basically *zero* candid discussions on the state of the technology and ***how it stands relative to adoption.*** There are basically *zero* attempts to map out the ecosystem in a comprehensive way so that 'investors' can have a clear picture of how some projects might interact with each other, allowing us to formulate enlightened guesses as to how much market share each might capture. Nobody seems to give a shit about decentralization *at all*, but I suspect for the vast majority, it was never about freedom and fairness, only profits.

Everybody strictly only celebrates when the market moves up without ever questioning the validity of that movement. When an asset inflates without any fundamental reason, its only achievement is the creation of a bubble that will inevitably result in severe losses for the majority of investors. 

With the size of this community (this subreddit alone), we have the power to warn others and to influence the market by infusing some rationality into it. So please, take the time to encourage others to look beyond immediate gains and to research the field. Take the time to criticize twitter ""influencers"". Take the time to reach out to professors, industry professionals and other knowledgeable experts to ask them their thoughts about specific projects and the market as a whole. We desperately need to create a global stage on which there is informed discourse, else this market will never truly grow.",554

This hack happened on October 14, 2018. I woke up early in the morning my local time. Right away I turned on the laptop and checked my inbox where I discovered the abnormally large volume of letters from the COSS Exchange. There were a few thousands of them. Each letter informed me about a failed attempt to enter my account on the Exchange.

All the security measures were taken properly:

I received all of the e-mails when I slept. I rushed to check the account and discovered that all my holdings were gone. More specifically, they were sold on low-liquid markets at the rates substantially lower than the market ones.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/ZF2LuWlV5rbwsO6FycUu4mea9ByL2f](https://monosnap.com/file/ZF2LuWlV5rbwsO6FycUu4mea9ByL2f)

In no time I turned to the support of the Exchange and informed about the incident. I wrote about this situation on Reddit and in the public Telegram group of the Exchange. Naturally, the first reaction that I experienced from the community was humiliation and accusations of stupidity. Many called me a dumb fool because I stored funds on the Exchange and so on. No need to point out how I kept the funds. I have what I have now. So on a weekly basis, the Exchange shares the trading fees with the holders of its tokens. The profit is distributed among token holders proportionally to the number of tokens they possess. That's why I decided to keep my tokens with COSS exchange.

The exchange claims:

They forgot to mention one small fact that access to my account was received using vulnerability which allowed hacker to perform brute force attack on my 2FA.

I was not the only victim as COSS declares in their medium blog and hacker indeed used exchange’s vulnerability:

What was that if not an exchange’s vulnerability?

The Exchange claims that the hacker had my password. Of course, the most natural and the easiest thing is to accuse the user of being responsible for the accident. But I can assure you that it is far from being the case. I have been in this industry since the end of 2011, and I do know how to generate and store wallets, passwords etc. I neither use Android smartphones, nor computers with Windows OS. I do not use SMS 2FA. I am meticulous and do not do bullshit. What if it was some internal job? Or users data base leaked? Ok, let's assume that I happened to become a victim/target of a hacker, who somehow managed to access my login and password (what I doubt A LOT). However, I had a 2FA verification installed for this occasion.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V](https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V)

It was designed exactly for the situations like the one I described above. 2FA enables to keep the funds safe even if the password/login was compromised. Recently I received a report from COSS compliance, in which they admitted that the brute force attack took place. After 25,000 trials the attack was successfully completed.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/va2jo4vKoY8BMpCiqVr2lp7AGT8AvO](https://monosnap.com/file/va2jo4vKoY8BMpCiqVr2lp7AGT8AvO)

The hacker got the access to my account and sold all my funds for nothing. After all the Exchange ignores my messages about refund and steps towards that. They’ve only stated amount of assets they were able to recover and  
[https://monosnap.com/file/K53lHFblRaeOLIVt6CUAF3P4tvE2LO](https://monosnap.com/file/K53lHFblRaeOLIVt6CUAF3P4tvE2LO)

claiming that it was the user's (mine) fault that the hacker managed to access the funds.[https://monosnap.com/file/McRLu9kY0vZuSGmVqU3ViDa2IljTkV](https://monosnap.com/file/McRLu9kY0vZuSGmVqU3ViDa2IljTkV)

How come? How would the hacker have accessed the funds if the Exchange had not allowed to perform the brute force attack? Even if it was me who had compromised the password in some magic way, 2FA had to serve the last stand. The hacker managed to brute force it using Exchange’s vulnerability and the Exchange has not stopped the brute force attack. Remember, there were 25,000 trials  
[https://monosnap.com/file/w1OOclQrPSuJFY4GzSpHCHABipfgKa](https://monosnap.com/file/w1OOclQrPSuJFY4GzSpHCHABipfgKa)

If I had additional time, I would manage to respond and prevent the hack. Even if there was my fault, but only 50%, the other half is that exchange gave the opportunity to the hacker to brute force 2FA. In this regard, I publicly call the COSS Exchange to refund me at least 50% of my account's balance.

Assets I had:

\~11 700 000 coss tokens (30kk$ at ATH period)

\~14 BTC

19 000 eos to refund in full (EOS node was down and hacker wasn’t able to withdraw EOS)  
[https://monosnap.com/file/kv0QqQd9nsLszRAJFE5vzJKx8J5aLQ](https://monosnap.com/file/kv0QqQd9nsLszRAJFE5vzJKx8J5aLQ)

\~ 22 ETH

The Exchange should bear the sole responsibility for the accident if its internal vulnerability allowed the hacker to accomplish his/her brute force attack.

If it would be possible to bypass 2FA protection with a brute force attack, every exchange/platform, as well as 2FA providers (generally Google), would be brought into disrepute and would face severe claims from their users. Basically, the whole industry would become a mess. If the case, exchanges/platforms would suffer multi-billion dollar losses, in particular, translating into even more significant losses for the industry as a whole.

No matter what decision COSS exchange will take I call other exchanges to add an extra security feature to protect user’s funds. TRADING PASSWORD. This will prevent anybody to sell user’s assets on the low liquidity markets for cents even if the password was compromised and exchange grants brute force attacks.

They manipulate markets, using the media, and they shake out the weak hands so they can scoop up everything they want for fractions of the price. The shit thing is it's working. Those guys you saw buying lambos and bullshit at the end of last year are the ones who didn't panic sell after the Mt Gox crash thinking ""Atleast I'll come out of this with something"". Look at the volumes at the moment, look at the amount of coins being accumulated right now, who do you think are the ones doing that? You think a bunch of investors with deep pockets just stumbled ass-backwards into the market and don't bother reading the news? Think. If you're selling right now you are selling to rich guys that know something you don't. 

Put the phone down, go an do whatever it was you were doing before crypto for the next month, for the next three months even. Or don't, panic sell to guys that know exactly what they are doing and lament it at the end of the year. We all saw the comments and posts of people warning that after the bull market will come days when everything drops 20% round the board. Well those days are here. No one ever got rich panic selling.  

I'm not frustrated cause my portfolio is dropping, it'll be back. I'm frustrated because all of us little guys have the possibility to ride this wave up because we got here early, and we're dropping like flies at the moment.

1. How Tether got to be what it is today

2. Why Tether's market cap is a lot more than 0.5% of the total market cap for crypto you see on CoinMarketCap

3. Tether printing timing

4. Tether reserves

5. What could happen to the market if Tether is found to not be backed by reserves

Tether is incredibly important to the cryptocurrency market ecosystem and I've noticed far too few people understand what is going on. 

Very little actual discussion of the 2nd biggest crypto by volume happens here and whenever someone starts a discussion they most often got slapped for ""FUD"". Tether themselves recently hired the major New York based PR firm 5W to spread positive information online and take down critics, I'm sure some of their operatives are probably on Reddit.

But its absolutely critical you understand the risks behind Tether and especially now with the explosion in reserve liability, breakdown in relationship with banks and their auditor and recently announced subpoena. 


#What exactly is Tether and what happened so far?

Tether is a cryptocurrency asset issued by Tether Limited (incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and a sister company of Bitfinex), on top of the Bitcoin blockchain through the Omni Protocol Layer. It is meant to give people a ""stablecoin"", for example a merchant who accepts bitcoin but fears its volatility could shift bitcoin into tether, which can be easier to do than exchanging bitcoin for dollars. Recently they've also added an Ethereum-based ERC20 token. Tether Ltd claims that each one of the tokens issued is backed by actual US dollar (and more recently Euro) reserves. The idea is that when a business partner deposits US dollars in Tether’s bank account, Tether creates a matching amount of tokens and transfers them to that partner, it is NOT a fractional reserve system.

Tether makes the two following key promises in its whitepaper on which the entire premise is build:

> Each tether issued will be backed by the equivalent amount of currency unit (one USDTether equals
one dollar).

>Professional auditors will regularly verify, sign, and publish our underlying bank balance and financial transfer statement.

Tether is centralized and dependent on your trust of Bitfinex/Tether Limited, and that the people behind it are honest people. For the new entrants to this market it will be greatly beneficial understand the timeline of Tether and their connection to Bitfinex.

A brief timeline:

* Bitfinex operators Phil Potter and CFO Giancarlo Devasini set up Tether Limited in the British Virgin Islands, but told the public that Bitfinex and Tether are completely separate. Throughout 2015 and 2016, the amount of Tether stays relatively flat.

* In August 2nd, 2016, the second-largest digital currency exchange heist in history happened, when Bitfinex lost nearly 120,000 bitcoin. Bitfinex never revealed full details of the hack, but BitGo (the security company that had to sign off on the transactions) claims its servers were not breached.  

* Just 4 days after the hack Bitfinex “socializes” its losses from the theft by announcing a 36 percent haircut for almost all of its customers. In return, customers receive BFX tokens, initially valued at $1 each. 

* Two weeks after the hack Bitfinex announces it has hired Ledger Labs, to investigate the theft and perform a financial audit of its cryptocurrency and fiat assets. The public nevers sees the results of the investigation, and months later, Bitfinex admits it never actually hired Ledger Labs to perform an audit to begin with.   

* In May 2017, after long standing calls for an actual audit, Bitfinex hires Friedman LLP to ""complete a comprehensive balance sheet audit.""

* November 7, 2017: Leaked documents dubbed “Paradise Papers” reveal Bitfinex and Tether are run by the same individuals.

* November 19, 2017: Tether is hacked, with 31 million USDT suddenly disappearing. Tether Limited reacts to this by creating a hard fork.

* December 4, 2017: Right after hiring the PR firm 5W to help improve their image, Bitfinex hires law firm Steptoe & Johnson and threatens legal action against critics.

* December 6, 2017 - CFTC issues a subpoena to Tether and Bitfinex. This news isn't made public until the end of January. 

* December 21, 2017 : Without making any formal announcement, Bitfinex appears to suddenly close all new account registrations. Those trying to register for a new account are asked for a mysterious referral code, but no referral code seems to exist.

* After a month of being closed to new registrations, Bitfinex announces it is reopening its doors, but now requires new customers to deposit $10,000 before they can begin trading.

* Friedman LLP completely cut ties with Tether on January 27, 2017.

#Most common misconception: Tether is only a small part of the total market cap

One of the most common misconception people have about cryptocurrencies is that the ""market cap"" amount they see on CoinMarketCap.com is actually the amount of money that is invested in each coin. 

I often hear people online dismiss any issue with tether by simply claiming its not big enough to cause any effect, saying ""Well Tether is only $2.2 billion on CoinMarketCap and the market is 400 billion, its only 0.5% of the market"". 


But this misunderstands what market capitalization for cryptocurrency is, and just how different the market cap for Tether is to every other token. The market cap is simply the last trade price times the circulating supply. It doesn't take into account the order book depth at all. The majority of Bitcoin (and most coins) are held by those who either mined or purchased for a very low price early on and simply held on as very small portions of the total supply was rapidly bid up to their current price.

An increase in market cap of X does NOT represent an inflow of X dollars invested, not even close. A 400 billion dollar market cap for crypto does NOT mean that there is 400 billion dollars underwriting the assets. Meanwhile a 2 billion dollar Tether market cap means there should be exactly $2 billion backing up the asset.

Nobody can tell for sure exactly how much money has been invested in cryptocurrency market, but [analysts from JPMorgan](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-02/jpmorgan-has-some-bad-news-bitcoin-bears) found that there was only net inflow of $6 billion fiat that resulted in $300 billion market cap at the time. This gives us a roughly 50:1 ratio of market cap to fiat inflow.  Prominent crypto evangelist Julian Hosp [gives the following estimate](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/heres-why-market-capitalisation-is-a-bad-way-to-measure-a-cryptocurrencys-value-2018-1): ""For a cryptocurrency to have a market cap of $1 billion, maybe only $50 million actually moved into the cryptocurrency.""

For Tether however the market cap is simply the outstanding supply, 2.2 billion USDT is actually equal to 2.2 billion USD. In order to get $50 USDT you have to deposit $50 real U.S. dollars and then 50 completely new tokens will be issued, which never existed before on the market.

What is also often ignored is that Bitfinex allows margin trading, at a 3.3x leverage. Bitfinexed did an excellent analysis on how tether is entering Bitfinex to fund margin positions

There are $2.2 billion in Tether outstanding and the current market cap of the entire market is $400 billion according to CoinMarketCap. You can actually calculate Tether as a % of total fiat invested in the market according to the JP Morgan estimate, the following table outlines for a scenario of no margin lending and 15/25% of tether being on a 3.3x leverage margin account:

Fiat Inflow/Market Cap Ratio | Tether as % of total market (no margin) | Tether as % of total market (15% on margin) | Tether as % of total market (25% on margin) 
----------|----------------|----------------|----------------
JP Morgan estimate (50:1) | 27.5 % | 36.9 % | 43.3 %

Even without any margin lending Tether is underwriting the worth of about 27.5% of the cryptocurrency market, and if we assume only 25% was leveraged out at 3.3x on margin we have a whole 43% of the market cap being driven by Tether inflow.

A much better indicator on CoinMarketCap of just how influential Tether is actually the volume, i[ts currently the 2nd biggest cryptocurrency by volume](http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour) and there are even days where its volume exceeds its market cap. 

What this all means is that not only is the market cap for cryptocurrencies drastically overestimating the amount of actual fiat capital that is underwriting those assets, but a **substantial portion of the entire market cap is being derived from the value of Tether's market cap rather than real money**.

Its incredibly important that more new investors realize that Tether isn't a side issue or a minor cog in the machine, but one of the core underlying mechanisms on which the entire market worth is built. **Ensuring that whoever controls this stablecoin is honest and transparent is absolutely critical to the health of the market.**

#Two main concerns with Tether

The primary concerns with Tether can be split into two categories:

1. Tether issuance timing - Does Tether Ltd issue USDT organically or is it timed to stop downward selling pressure? 

2. Reserves - Does Tether Ltd actually have the fiat reserves at a 1:1 ratio, and why is there still no audit or third party guarantee of this?


#Does Tether print USDT to prop up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

In the last 3 months the amount of USDT has nearly quadrupled, with nearly a billion being printed in January alone. Some people have found the timing of the most recent batch of Tether as highly suspect because it seemed to coincide with Bitcoin's price being propped up. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html

This was recently analyzed statistically: 

>Author’s opinion - it is highly unlikely that Tether is growing through any organic business process, rather that they are printing in response to market conditions.

>Tether printing moves the market appreciably; 48.8% of BTC’s price rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following the arrival of 91 different Tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet. 

>Bitfinex withdrawal/deposit statistics are unusual and would give rise to further scrutiny in a typical accounting environment.

https://www.tetherreport.com

I'm still undecided on this and I would love to see more statistical analysis done, because the price of Bitcoin is so volatile while Tether printing only happens in large batches. Simply looking at the Bitcoin price graph over the last 3 months and then the Tether printing its pretty clear there is a relationship but it doesn't seem to hold over longer periods.

Ultimately to me this timing isn't that much of an issue, as long Tether is backed by US dollars. If Bitfinex was timing the prints then it accounts to not much more than an organized pumping scheme, which isn't a fundamental problem. The much more serious concern is whether those buy order are being conducted on the faith of fictitious  dollars that don't exist, regardless of when those buy orders occur.


#Didn't Tether release an audit in September?

Some online posters have recently tried to spread the notion that Tether has actually been audited by Friedman LLP and that a report was released in September 2017. That was actually just a consulting engagement, which you can read here:

https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf

They clearly state that:

>This engagement does not contemplate tests of accounting records or the performance of other procedures performed in an audit or attest engagement. Our procedures performed are not for the purpose of providing assurance...In addition, our services do not include determination of compliance with laws and regulations in any jurisdiction. 

They state right from the beginning that this is a consultancy job (not an audit), and that its not meant to be assurance to third parties. Doing a consultancy job is just doing a task asked by your customer. In a consultancy job you take information as true from the client, and you have no mandate to verify whether your customer's claims are true or not. The way they checked is simply asking Tether to provide them the information:

>All inquiries made through the consulting process have been directed towards, and the data obtained from, the Client and personnel responsible for maintaining such information.

Tether provided a screenshots of twp bank balances. One of these is in the name of Tether Limited, and while the other is a personal account of an individual who Tether Limited claims has a trust agreement with them:

>As of September 15, 2017, the bank held $60,919,810 in **an account in the name of an in individual for the benefit of Tether Limited**. FLPP obtained an engagement letter for an interim settlement plan between that individual and Tether Limited and that **according to Tether Limited, is the relevant agreement with the trustee. FLLP did not evaluate the substance of the letter and makes no representation about its legality.**

Even worse is that later on in Note 1, they clearly claim that there is no actual evidence that this engagement letter or trust has any legal merit:

>**Note 1: FLLP makes no representations about sufficiency or enforceability of any trust agreement between the trustee and the Client**

Essentially what this is saying is that the trust agreement may not even be worth the paper it’s printed on. 

And most importantly… Note 2:

>“**FLLP did not evaluate the terms of the above bank accounts and makes no representations about the clients ability to access funds from the accounts or whether the funds are committed for purposes other than Tether token redemptions**”

Basically Tether gave them a name of an individual with $60 million in their account according to a screenshot, Tether then gave them a letter saying that there is a trust agreement between this individual and Tether Limited. They also have account with $382 million but no guarantee that this account holds to any lien or other commitments, or that it can be accessed. 

Currently Tether has 2.2 billion USDT outstanding and we have absolutely no idea whether this is actually backed by anything, and the long promised audit is still outstanding.


# What happens if its revealed that Tether doesn't have its US dollar reserves?

According to Thomas Glucksmann, head of business development at Gatecoin: ""If a tether debacle unfolds, it will likely cause quite a devastating ripple effect across many of the exchanges that see most of their volumes traded against the supposedly USD-backed cryptocurrency.""

According to Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley: ""You could see a spike in prices in tether-only bitcoin exchanges. So, on those exchanges only you will see a run up in price compared to the bitcoin exchanges that actually work with actually money. So you would see a huge price diverge as people see that only way they can turn tether into real money is to buy other cryptocurrency then move to another exchange. That is a bank run.""

I definitely see the crypto equivalent of a bank run, as people actually try to secure their gains an realize that this money doesn't actually exist within the system:

> If traders lose confidence in it and its value starts to drop, “people will run for the door,” says Carlson, the former Wall Street trader. If Tether can’t meet all its customers’ demand for dollars (and its Terms of Service suggest that in many cases it won’t even try), tether holders will try to snap up other cryptocurrencies instead, temporarily causing prices for those currencies to soar. With tether’s role as an inter-exchange facilitator compromised, investors might lose faith in cryptocurrencies more generally. “At the end of the day, people would be losing substantial sums, and in the long term this would be very bad for cryptocurrencies,” says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor and co-director of its Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts.

>Another concern is that Bitfinex might simply shut down, pocketing the bitcoins it has allegedly been stockpiling. Because people who trade on Bitfinex allow the exchange to hold their money while they speculate, these traders could face substantial losses. “The exchanges are like unregulated banks and could run off with everyone’s money,” says Tony Arcieri, a former Square employee turned entrepreneur trying to build a legally regulated exchange.

https://www.wired.com/story/why-tethers-collapse-would-be-bad-for-cryptocurrencies/

The way I see it, this would be how it plays out if Tether collapses:

1. Tether-enabled exchanges will see a massive spike in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices as everyone leaves Tether. Noobs in these exchanges will think they are now millionaires until they realize they are rich in tethers but poor in dollars.

2. Exchanges that have not integrated Tether will experienced large drops in Bitcoin and alts as experienced investors flee crypto into USD. 

3. There will be a flight of Bitcoin from Tether-integrated exchanges to non-Tether exchanges with fiat off-ramps. Exchanges running small fractional reserves will be exposed, further increasing calls for greater reserves requirements.

4. The exchanges might slam the doors shut on withdrawals.

5. Many exchanges that own large balances of Tether, especially Bitfinex, will likely become insolvent. 

6. There will be lawsuits flying everywhere and with Tether Limited being incorporated on a Carribean Island whose solvency and bankruptcy laws will likely ensure they don't ever get much back. This could take years and potentially push away new investors from entering the space.

#Conclusion

We can't be 100% completely sure that Tether is a scam, but its so laiden with red flags that at this point I would call it the biggest systematic risk in the crypto space. Its bigger than any nation's potential regulatory steps because it cuts right into the issue of trust across the entire ecosystem.

Ultimately Tether is centralizing one of the very core mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets and asking you to trust one party to be the safekeeper, and I really see very little reason to trust Bitfinex given their history of lying and screwing over their own customers. I think that Tether initially started as a legit business to facilitate the ease of moving money and avoiding regulations, but somewhere along the lines greed and/or incompetence took over (something that seems common with Bitfinex's previous actions). Right now we're playing proverbial hot potato, and as long as people believe that Tether is worth a dollar everything is fine, but as some point the Emperor will have to step out from hiding and somebody will point out they have no clothes.

In the long term I really hope once Tether collapses we can move on and get the following two implemented which would greatly improve the market for all investors:

1. Actual USD fiat pairings on the major exchanges for the major currencies

2. Regulatory rules on exchange reserve requirements 

I had watched the Bitconnect people insist for the last 2 years that everything about Bitconnect made perfect sense because they were getting paid daily. The scam works until one day it suddenly doesn't. 

Tether could still come clean and avoid all of this ""FUD"" by simply getting a simple review of their banking, they don't even need a full audit. If everything was legit with Tether, it would be incredibly easy to have a segregated bank account with the funds used solely to back up Tether, then have an third party accounting firm simply review the account and a bank reconciliation statement then spend a few hours in contact with the bank to ensure no outstanding liabilities are held on that balance. This is extremely basic stuff, it would take a few hours to set up and wouldn't take a lot of man-hours for a qualified account to do, and yet they don’t do it. Why? Why hire a major PR firm and spend god knows how much money to pay professional PR representatives to attack ""FUD"" online instead?

I think I know why.

Fuckers.

I just want to give everyone a heads up that shits about the get real in so many ways and YOU are here early.  Yes, you, the guy that bought in December and thinks you'll never recover from all your losses.

Let's go over a few of the things we know about.

1.  The top talent in the world are leaving their old tech/finance jobs and entering blockchain.  Everywhere you look, we're seeing this.  From hedge fund managers, to JP Morgan/Goldman Sachs execs, to Google execs.  Gee golly, why are the most talented and intelligent people in the world entering crypto? 

2.  Banks are diving balls deep into crypto (mostly behind the scenes).  First the banks ignored crypto, then they laughed at crypto, then they attacked it by calling it a ""scam.""  Now they're acquiring exchanges (Poloniex), about to open trading desks, investing in projects (Digital Currency Group), and are in a race to get in before their competitors.

3.  Custodial Services: I cannot overstate the importance of this.  As I've written before, Coinbase is going to be at the forefront of mass adoption and are going to play a key role in all of this.  They've recently been hiring INSANE amounts of management positions, engineers, and something around 500 new customer service reps.  This is because they're about to roll out their custodial program where every credit union and some participating major banks are going to offer their crypto index fund to their customers.  Baby boomer (and Gen X) Mom n Dad are going to walk into their local credit union to talk to their financial advisor and he's going to offer them a new product that is extremely volatile, however, got a return of about 1000% last year. He's going to suggest 2-5% of their portfolio would be ok to invest and these coins are going to be insured; They will never have to trade for crypto or make accounts on sketchy exchanges to get them, just gets their broker to buy them like any other financial product.

4.  The demand for OTC crypto is insane.  This is why you see Gemini and Coinbase starting their own Bloc trading services.  Who and why is there so much OTC demand?

5.  Liquidity is about to blow up.  If you don't understand what liquidity does for markets/coin value, do a bit of research.  The exchange union is coming, where the participating exchanges share liquidity.

6.  Because of this future liquidity, traditional securities (company shares, bonds) and commodities will be represented by crypto.  This one's going to take some time, but you can see the writing on the wall here.  This is going to be where crypto is in full-fledged mass adoption-mode. 


Unfortunately back in December/January crypto wasn't quite ready for the explosion that happened. Exchanges had to freeze trading, not allow new sign-ups, not enough service reps, low security on exchanges, and the tech in general wasn't quite ready but things are changing this year, 2018.  Sit back, open a cold one with the boys, make love to your smokin' hot wife, go play catch outside with your kids, and enjoy yourselves because we're about to witness history - And your all a part of it my friends.  Cheers!

Crypto has changed my life in a completely different way…it has made me hungry for knowledge. Cyber, networking, blockchain knowledge.

I use to find myself sitting at my computer desk reading random articles from random websites about every single random blockchain that caught my attention. I would invest in a project.... make a little money, then switch to another project... lose a little money. 

I’m not going to lie…I don’t have what it takes to be a day trader…lesson learned.

However, I kept finding myself hungry for more knowledge. I wanted to know everything about everything.

Finally, one day I was staring at my computer….basically broke and feeling slightly depressed due to a downturn in the market….and decided to do something about it. My old ass went back to school. 

Now I’m proud to say, 4 years later, I have recently finished my Bachelors in Cyber Security, Comptia Sec+ and A+ certs and I even finished up my Associates from when I was 18 and dropped out my final semester. Dumb…I know. But I personally know I would have never decided to take this path without crypto influencing me. 

Next time you find yourself staring at coinmarketcap and the price of your coins, try to find what aspects of these coins excite you (other than the lambos) THEN GO LEARN. See if this is your passion. You don’t even have to go to college. You can find hundreds of learning resources online. Go better yourself and help this community grow.

If crypto somehow implodes tomorrow, will you have anything to show for all the time you have spent staring at your computer/phone screen? Or will it all be screenshots, memories, and what could have beens?

Verge is a shitcoin.

What problem does it solve better than any of the top 10, what is it's purpose, and why is it worth what it is worth?

If you can't answer these questions honestly, then it is in fact... a shitcoin.

Now, besides all that, the coin was literally hacked last week, and the price of it was actually still going up... in a fucking bear market. Now come on, even if you jerk off to this coin, and spread its greatness all around the interwebs, even you have to admit that it's a bit fucking suspicious right?

Then, the sole developer, living in his moms basement, allegedly, with a bit too much hair on his neck, allegedly, has the ball to tell his community, that he will release news on the ""biggest partnership in cryptocurrency history"" if... you give him millions of dollars.... to pay his taxes... allegedly.

And then he goes ahead, and changes the big announcement date to the 17th of April, which so happens to be the exact day all United States taxes are due... coincidence?

I mean I wish I was making this shit up people, but are people really this fucking dumb, or is the developer actually being trolled himself, and these so called investors are actually just 4Channers waiting to pump and dump this thing like nothing ever seen before?

That's the only explanation I could come up with, that or the whole thing is being manipulated by team McAfee, hence the original push... what say you guys?",864

Me: I do not support CitiBank's stance against cryptocurrencies
CC: Would you continue to use the card if we gave you Rs.1000 cash back? Also 10x reward points on every purchase.
Me: Will you be accepting transactions related to cryptocurrency?
CC: I'll forward the request to cancel the credit card.
Me: Thanks...

Edit: The amount offered is Rupees 1000 or 15.05 US Dollar. I was getting 0.8% cash back so that was already bad.
Edit2: I cancelled the account because they don't let Debit card or Bank account transactions for Crypto as well. It's not about buying crypto.

The tribalism is a big problem and will get us nowhere. I don't go around downvoting posts for mentioning coins that aren't in my portfolio... seems like I'm the last guy around that thinks that way.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

&#x200B;

Wow, I did not expect this simple post to resonate with so many people and cause this much discussion. This is a good thing, it shows many of us acknowledge this problem. I also was not trying to single out Vechain or Nano, or delegitimize those projects, they are just the first two offenders that came to mind. I know there are many more cryptocurrency communities that the same can be said for but I won't name names, because that isn't the point of this post.

&#x200B;

Let's do something about this. Don't be that guy/girl, don't downvote a post simply because it references a coin that you don't own or a project that directly competes against one of your big holdings. I get it, the same amount of coins that you hold today are worth maybe 10% of the value that it was in early 2018. I also get that you probably consolidated most of your losses into a few projects, maybe even just one that you are the most confident can come back. Cool, good for you, I hope it works out. But don't censor posts simply because they go against an agenda of pumping your bags. It makes us all look bad and no one just coming into this space is going to want to stick around if this is what they are greeted with. Let's try and learn something new  instead of shouting as loud as we can about our coins and silencing those that disagree with us. This is an exciting time to be alive, we can't allow tunnel vision to get in the way of the big picture here. We are all still early, there is still so much to learn and so much to gain from being in this space right now.",463

We just saw it again now as they liquidated 3K longs but you [can see this pattern of clear manipulation over and over in the last few weeks ](https://i.imgur.com/LpgnksQ.png).

We have seen several forces set an incentive for exchanges to do this:

* Consistently declining volume - this leads to lower total fee revenue for exchanges, and an incentive to manipulate the price in order to earn revenue through liquidations rather than trading fees.

* Move towards more leveraged positions - both leveraged shorts and leveraged longs are [at or near record levels.](https://i.imgur.com/ljSohM5.png) Shorts especially have gone from 8K outstanding in January to 33K right now, a whole tripling in outstanding positions. 

* Move away from the spot market and towards derivatives - Anybody who has been checking [the combined orderbook](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD) over the last few months has seen Bitmex completely take over the market, while GDAX, Bitfinex, Gemini and others see consistent declines. I've noticed myself an increased interest across the Internet on how derivatives work and anecdotely I have seen more people move away from the HODL meme and towards trading taking high margin bets with a portion of their stack.

Some exchanges like Gemini have reacted to all of this by increasing their trading fees by 400%. Meanwhile Bitfinex specifically seems to be using its hefty weight to manipulate the price in order to capitalize on the record number of people using margin to bet. 

Both longs and shorts are bets on the price moving up or down and they have a ""liquidation price"" at which they get liquidated by the exchange, essentially the exchange gets the entire stack they bet with and extracts a high market fee multiplied by the leverage. Since the exchanges know the characteristics of the outstanding shorts/longs, and since volume is low after these pumps or dumps leading to sideways drift, they can essentially engineer movements in price that create income in terms of liquidations. When there are lots of overleveraged shorts, an exchange can pump the price with bots briefly and collect the short position. Same with longs but in reverse, a quick burst of selling pressure.

You can see this in the most recent pumps too on Bitfinex, where 1K buy orders appear out of nowhere after long sideways movement only to be followed by either sideway movement or slow bleed on pathetic volume:

https://i.imgur.com/3YaWVBI.png

https://i.imgur.com/pvpcd7Z.png

Take a look at the most recent pump up to 7K, it instantanously liquidated about 700 short positions:

https://i.imgur.com/3sCLEB8.png

Now this last dump was a laddered 12.5K sell order on Bitfinex that liquidated around 3K long contracts

https://i.imgur.com/znYyUT8.png

Bitfinex tends to be where the big money traders move (their minimum deposit is 10K) so even if each long position was only 0.5 BTC on average they exchange would make a ton of money. If you look at the BitmexRekt twitter feed that shows a running list of Bitmex liquidations with humorous commetary, [you will see many >$1 million dollar positions being liquidated during these moves.](https://i.imgur.com/fbeJxOT.png)

This is what all the ""Bart"" formations we have seen stem from. Its not George Soros pumping Bitcoin for shits and giggles, nor is it the nebolous ""whales"". They have no incentive to try and pull off PnDs now that it only leads to either sideways movement or decline after the pump. A PnD only works if the delta between the top of the pump end point and dump initiation point is positive, while now it seems to be followed by sideways movement. Those who do want to bet on further upward movements seem to be doing it off the spot market, using margin with futures and perpetuity swaps on Bitmex. This makes the low volume spot market ripe for manipulation, exchanges like Bitfinex and Bitmex have every incentive right now to manipulate the price. 

Looking back it seems almost inevitable that this would have happened, that traders would try to replicate the gains they saw by buying and selling on the spot market a few months ago by using increased leverage and derivatives. In December and January there were days where your holdings would increase by at least 20% no matter what you bought. Once you experience those 20% daily gains you don't want to go back to a market where it slowly bleeds down a few percent every week, so people jumped in on high leverage short positions to multiply their profit on those single percent moves down.

For the small time investor there really isn't much you can do to stop this. This is what being part of an unregulated market means, it means that things like wash trading and long/short liquidation hunting is allowed. 

All you can really do if you're a trader is look at the current ratio of longs vs shorts on Bitfinex and be aware that once short contracts become too high its possible that an exchange may pump the price to profit on it, while if the longs become too dominant we may see a dump.

Edit: Bitfinex, not Bitfenix.

Few months ago I was browsing the net and came across a website (bittrex) that offers cryptocurrency trading, so I did my research and few days later, exactly on 25. June 2017 I bought my first 0.25btc (around 500e back then) and started trading. Ethereum, antshares, litecoin, stratis, waves and so on and so on, I lost few $ on shilled coins but I gained much more on ICOs and altcoin trading.

After few months I was looking at a portfolio of over 5000e without any further investment mostly achieved by the rocket moon of bitcoin and just by doing some turnarounds and daily trades. That was in September 30th and on that day my grandfather has been diagnosed with a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in an early stage where his right side of lungs is affected by a tumour. We're originally from Slovakia so the only option to get this treated was to undergo a surgery to remove the tumour, but considering how bad is the Slovakian healthcare we weren't willing to go forward with this procedure(only procedure covered by his healthcare). The only option was to privately pay for a treatment abroad. After a very long search we found a private clinic that could help us, Oncology clinic in Prague, which was costly but they had the best surgeons to help us.

Few days passed and we received a quote for the treatment. Where the fuck are we going to get 7900e was the next question that went through my mind, my grandparents are on absolutely hilarious Slovakian pension of 420e/month and there was no way they could afford this. My mother couldn't help because her financial situation wasn't any better and then it struck me...Let's take the profits from crypto and use it to pay for the surgery and that's exactly what I did. I cashed out all my crypto and ended up with 6300e on my bank account. Flew to Prague to undergo the initial examination and few weeks later, on 17th of November my granddad had a surgery where the whole right side of his lungs had to be removed due to the spread of the tumour. His weight dropped to 62kg(-18kg in less than two months) and he was having horrendous pains because of the ribs that had to be snapped to access the lungs during the surgery. Everything went good and there were no complications during or after the surgery.

As of today, 18th of December, less than 4 months after he has been diagnosed we received the final results of his progress and cancer stage. No cancerous cells were find anywhere in his body, his lungs are working great, no liver damage and he's now at hom, regaining weight and strenght, all well and healthy, looking forward to spend another few healthy years with his family and loved ones. I know that this fight is probably not over yet as cancer will most likely return at one point, but for now we won and all of this thanks to cryptomarket, without crypto we wouldn't be able to afford this surgery and give him another few years of life to enjoy.",242

In the 2008 stock market crash, the S&P 500 went back to the value it had 10 YEARS ago. 

Crypto has been set back 23 days. 

An equivalent 23-day setback on the stock market would mean a drop of about 3%. Can you imagine the news freaking out about a 3% drop? 

I see nothing to worry about, just normal fluctuations in a healthy (but volatile) market. I bet in a few months the market cap will be back to where it was. What can be done and undone in 23 days can  be redone again in 23 days. There's too much overall momentum toward cryptos, even if a 23-day bubble is popping. It's not a 10-year bubble. This is the thing people have to realize. 

Let's imagine, even if (worst case) the whole crypto market cut in half _again_ on top of where we are now, we'd only be set back to late November, about 50 days ago. Internet money is simply useful, and that's not going to change. And we're clearly still at the front(ish) end of the mass adoption curve. These two things are the bedrock of the investment in to cryptocurrencies, and those things haven't changed. 

If you were to panic sell now, I'm guessing in about a couple months you will be regretting it. Almost certainly in a few years you will be regretting it. Imagine cryptos going up another 1000% (which it has, more than once over the years) and you sold because you got cold feet after a 20% movement. A 23-day bubble is not worth being emotional about if you're a long-term investor, which is generally the smartest and lowest-risk way to invest. 

Plus we have no way of knowing how much of this is just one whale getting in and out of the market to create profitable price swings. That can (and probably will) happen again. 

The ocean isn't draining because we're at the low point of a big wave. There will be other waves, and other high points. It's just a matter of patience. As long as the two bedrock principles of why to invest in crypto are still in place (people want internet money, and we are in early adoption phase) I see no reason to sell. ",441

Here's the thing, I don't know shit, and you don't know shit. So, now that we are both level headed, you and I both agree we are shitbrains that don't know what will happen in the market, let's talk about psychology.

When BTC 2x, 3x or 5x, your little peepee will get tingly. The memes will be flowing, you'll be big dick swinging in your 1 bedroom basement apartment in the ""up and coming"" side of town as you check your crypto portfolio multiple times in the middle of the night while people you used to hang out with are out having a good time playing fortnite or whatever the fuck kids are playing these days.

Despite the fact you've already said that you're ""in this for the long haul,"" you're still checking your portfolio like an instagramer stalks people on their timeline.

Why the fuck are you checking prices every 15 minutes still if you're a long term hodler?

The passed10k.gif will come back out of retirement eventually, and you'll be picking colors for your lambo all from your $100 investment into bitshitnect coin.

Then, it will happen. Nobody knows when, but all it takes is a sudden gush of short term traders to sell and wreck your hard hodl'd gains.

You will rush to your favorite shitposting site and blast to the world, ""I was just up 3x, now BTC is down 50% in the last week! What's going on? It's that damn whale again, isn't it!?""

A few people will tell you to keep hodling, ""This is just the beginning,"" they say. But you're smarter than that. You just held through a 3x gain, then lost 50% of those gains. You'll soon get  your confirmation bias from a couple dipshit redditors, ""Derp, 3x gains ain't nothing to sneeze at. Herp, you should have sold then rebought during this correction and you'd have doubled your stack, hurrrr.""

You'll think, ""Wow, your hindsight is absolutely right. Next time it happens, I'll be prepared and I will predict the market with 100% accuracy. I'll say I'm a long term hodler, but I'll keep checking the prices 20 times a day hoping to perfectly time the top and bottom. I'm a very stable genius.""

Then, BTC will have a small bounce up of 15% the next week. You'll find someone that you agree with on Trading View that tells everyone, ""It's going to go retest the shit support at shit level fibonichi 0.69. The pullout method is upon us, there is a 420% chance I'm right, and .007 chance I'm wrong. I'm not your financial adviser, I'm just a guy shilling my ideas hoping I get enough support to influence the market. No collusion!""

You'll sell, the market will bounce back up another 20%, you'll fomo, the market will tank another 50%. You'll sell at another loss, it will drop another 10% and you'll run to reddit, ""I knew it was going to drop, so I sold! I just made 10% more by selling""...but you didn't actually buy yet because you think it's going to drop a little bit further.

You won't tell people you also just got wrecked your previous 4 times doing this and you're down more than 70% during a bull run because you kept trying to time the market.

Of those that are reading this now, my guess is, **at best**, only 1 out of every 100 people will actually DCA or just hodl through the next bull run.

There are going to be multiple, and I'm talking many month long shakeouts along the way to wherever BTC is going.

I don't think 99% of people have the patience and the will to hodl through the gains and the massive selloffs.

You're here now, you've been through a bear market. But, seeing gains is a much different beast. I suspect that once you deal with the 3rd or 4th major shakeout after 3x, 5x, 6x gains, I'm talking truly massive 50-75% selloffs in a few days, that you won't be able to stomach it for long.

Some have $10,000-$50,000 invested down here. Imagine in a year that you have 2x, 3x, or 5x that. Then, you lose 70% of your gains in a week.

This is a real possibility, multiple times. Whether you have $100, $1000, or $50,000 invested down here during the bear market, you need to prepare for that feeling of getting absolutely wrecked in a week.

Some among us are going to have their $20,000 turn into $80,000 or $100,000, then drop to $30,000 or $25,000 in the next 12-18 months.

Imagine this happening multiple times, this 3-6x then losing 70% of those gains, multiple times in a relatively short period of time. Imagine months long consolidation after a sell off, then another shakeout after you were just wishing you would have sold.

It's nice to look at a chart in hindsight and say, ""Zoom out,"" but going through it is a lot more difficult than just looking at the past history from a chart.

You'll be able to hodl through 1 or 2 selloffs, but at some point you're going to be having a stressful week or a stressful month in the next few years. it's going to coincide with a massive selloff and you're going to be sitting there thinking, ""shit, I would have been better off just selling last time. This shit is too stressful.""

For the record, there is nothing wrong with selling at a 2x, 3x, or 5x or whatever you choose, but I remain extremely skeptical that people will actually hodl all the way to the top or near the top of the next bull market, let alone being able to predict when and where that is. Even fewer among us will DCA all the way through and sell at whatever the next top will be.

This is a cruel game, and you won't make it unscathed. Most will fail because of a lack of planning.

Prove me wrong, fellow hodlers and DCAers.

Prove me fucking wrong.

**TL;DR**: Comment based on the title, otherwise read the shit.

*Edit : For the record, I don't know shit, but I do think the top of the next bull market will be $180,000 to $225,000. I have no idea what happens in between now and then. You don't either. And, again, I don't know that it will actually get there, but my spidey senses tell me that. I'd expect it to be around August 2021 and January 2022 though. In a few years. I'll only have about 50% of my stack by that point because I have certain intervals I'm selling because I know I could be wrong; again, I don't know shit so I'm going to sell as I reach certain targets. I'll be DCAing most of the way through, and I'll see you all in crypto hell regardless, you filthy casuals.*",815

* **Helping those of us with significant crypto holdings become informed on how to proceed with 2017 taxes**
* **Strengthen our position as legitimate law-abiding citizens**
* **Not holding anyone legally responsible for ""legal advice"" who contributes to this discussion thread** (this is about getting our bearings)

If you are like me you found 2017 to be a very good year for you. I'm not talking to the people who got in on this in early December and made $1,000. I'm talking to those of us who saw our modest yet respectable holding of bitcoins grow to jaw-dropping prices and then continued to diversify our digital portfolio to the point that we may now be holding dozens of currencies traded at various times on a variety of exchanges.

What we are doing is legal and has been legal for years. I am one of those [alleged 802 people who pays their taxes on Coinbase](http://fortune.com/2017/03/19/irs-bitcoin-lawsuit/). And let me tell you, the professional accounting firm I use to pay my taxes charged me a pretty penny for basically knowing the one thing everyone does know about cryptocurrency - that [you have to pay long-term capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies you've held for over a year and sold for American dollars](https://bitcoin.tax/blog/bitcoin-taxes-common-questions/). So that's what I've been doing and I've been doing that with each bitcoin being considered at 100% profit because I bought all my bitcoins from Mt. Gox! Maybe you've never payed taxes on all the bitcoin you sold but let's face it - in 2017 you better pay your taxes and you better know what you're talking about and doing. A lot of us have found ourselves with serious money that we did not have until 2017.

The real problem comes from the variety of exchanges we've joined and the amount of trading of currencies on these exchanges. Many of these exchanges are also not illegal to use. While Bitcoin has been on the IRS radar for a while these exchanges specialize in something that has never been truly significant enough to get the IRS's full attention until 2017. But this problem is multi-faceted:

* **In 2017, was exchanging one crypto for another crypto considered a taxable event?** - [The fact is there isn't a clear answer on this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2017/12/28/loophole-allows-tax-free-bitcoin-exchanges-into-2018/#4f50d7b312fa). With the IRS tying cryptocurrencies down as property (rather than currencies which- as I understand it- wouldn't be taxed) they allowed the loophole of the 1031 which allows swaps for like-kind properties. The IRS called cryptos properties, people are swapping cryptos with each other (literally) while small fees are charged for using the network or exchange, and thus - it could be argued that all exchanges *between* cryptos are NOT a taxable event. I personally like this idea but I clearly have a bias. There are many other people who claim that all cryptocurrency transactions between each other are taxable and this comes with its own bag of worms. And indeed, the rock-star new Republican tax code does mirror this sentiment by solely claiming 1031 use for Real Estate. So this leaves us with another question:

* **What legal stance should we take when talking with our accountants/ doing our taxes?** The stunning impossibility of what is expected of us LEGAL citizens doing LEGAL trading in order to report on our taxes, if we do take the stance that all crypto transactions are taxable, is so highly complex that it's almost like the IRS is forcing all crypto-traders into an illegal space. In a sense they are trip-wiring the entire crypto market with expectations that are impossible to follow. We must have some legal rights here or at least legal stances that we can take when dealing with such a new fast paced market and such a slowly-responding vaguely-directed bureaucracy like the IRS. In [one of the better crypto tax threads on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m56g0/the_absolute_fucking_impossibility_of_reporting/) one person expressed with acute detail the amount of problems recording all of our transactions really are based on the current IRS expectations which are vague and the IRS is not giving a clear answer on whether cryptos are allowed to be considered exempted using 1031. Even if they were there still is expected a way to report everything. My accountant will want to do whatever is safest for them and likely the most expensive for me. How do I ensure a reasonable approach is taken by my tax professional that considers my needs and not just throwing as much money at the IRS as possible? I want to pay my taxes but I want tax laws to be fair on crypto, which leaves me to my next point:

* **What is the best way to look at crypto from a tax point of view?** Currently cryptocurrency is a square peg in a round hole. The IRS, clearly unprepared (as we all were) for the massive attention and growth of cryptocurrency in 2017 was already stuffed into the the ""property"" hole despite being developed and created for *much more* than that. Cryptocurrency - whether you want to call it an asset or a currency - is already billions of dollars deep in projects that are meant to change the way entire systems operate *on a global scale*! This is a global thing taking place within  different countries. We already pay capital gains taxes or income taxes when we exchange them into dollars which is a fair and easily reliable system to document - is it even right for the IRS to tax more? While there may be some in here who believe nobody should be paying taxes with cryptos I think that cryptos (like everything else) should have some taxable responsibility- but not so much that it becomes highly burdensome and a legal minefield allowing the IRS specter to be chasing you for alleged misdoings years down the line. And if crypto is as successful as its going to be there will likely be less of a reason to exchange into dollars anymore thus losing the leverage of the capital gains/income tax. And looking into the short term future decentralized exchanges are even going to be set up potentially removing the ability to track cryptos in any form whatever! What is the appropriate way to tax crypto basing it on the fact that it IS crypto and not necessarily merely ""property"" or ""currency""?

* **What level of responsibility do exchanges play in 2017 taxes?** Being a proud Coinbase tax payer I had the privilege of giving my tax accountant a printed out piece of paper with a terrible excel sheet on it that displayed my yearly bitcoin transactions and told them that this was the best document they were going to get. I haven't gotten the information from Coinbase this year yet, and hopefully they've improved the quality of the report but  *at least there is one*. I just tried looking for how to get the information from Bittrex and while it may be available it wasn't easy to find with a google-search or on their website. **That** is a problem. This is an exchange that is legally allowed to operate in the United States. I could sign up to Bitcoin.tax to find out the information allegedly but I really should not have to sign up to anywhere to find out how to get my annual tax document from my exchange. And if they don't provide one then why is the United States legally allowing them to operate within their borders? If the IRS decides to take their records two years down the line like they did in 2017 with Coinbase and they come to us asking us why we didn't report something and it was because there was no easy/possible way to obtain the records from the users end, how can that be our fault? It would be great if there was a sticky-noted thread on ANY of these crypto boards on how to obtain a document of the year's transactions from every one of the exchanges out there because many of us need them. There is an expectation that we are supposed to calculate the amount gained from when we first purchased a currency to when we traded it for another currency. Aside from the fact that even if we are provided an annual report document it won't be in dollars - it will be in BTC or ETH or USDT or some other pairing at a specific time with a specific amount in those pairings on that specific exchange. The dollar correlation that's needed - if not provided - makes reporting crypto transactions nearly impossible.

* **How are we supposed to accommodate for transactions to and from wallets?** Say we can do all of those things above but now we move it to a private wallet for safekeeping. From there we might send it to another wallet as it intermingles with other coins and from there they are traded on other exchanges. What is the dollar correlation there? What is the appropriate gains? Which exchange did you buy *that specific coin* from? This all matters for taxes but almost impossible to track between wallets and exchanges. If it can't be done, how can we be held accountable to do it? If we can't do it, then what legal ground do we have to say what is being expected is byzantine and unrealistic? Also, it's my understanding that we don't need to report coins in private wallets but that'll be nearly impossible not to do if we have to do all this tracking.

* **Who specializes in cryptocurrency?** - Maybe we can't find all the answers here but some of you out there must be able to point us in the direction of someone that can give us answers. I'm not talking about the conservative tax lawyer that's going to make sure you pay every last dime in a way that would make the IRS want them to be the new head of the department - and I'm not talking about the shady guy who promises that you can get out of paying a dime. I'm talking professionals that aren't just going to be pushed over and know their stuff on this topic. I will gladly pay for this legal muscle to ensure I am legally participating in our society through crypto transactions while not just trying to tax me every time I click the mouse.

Some people say just to ignore all of this tax mess because the IRS is likely to change their stance 10 more times. But I don't want to ignore it because cryptocurrency is already seen as a shady business. And it's not - it's a globally disruptive technology that provides benefits many centralized systems can't and it's the reason why it's busting through the $700 billion market cap at the beginning of 2018. Please, let's organize and approach our taxes honestly and in an informed fashion this year. The fact is many of us in the crypto community visit crypto subreddits and together - with a similar mentality, attitude, drive, and direction- we can influence the crypto policy to be fair to both the country and the crypto-trader.

==================================================================================
Ignore news designed to get your attention and to promote fear.
America never suppresses Innovation.
Innovations start and flourish in America.
==========
When they (the banks and recent crackdown on customers) fear you, they try to suppress you. But wait, innovation always wins.
==========

Highlights from tomorrow's testimony from Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman-

1. ""These warnings are not an effort to undermine the fostering of innovation through our capital markets –**America was built on the ingenuity, vision and spirit of entrepreneurs who tackled old and new problems in new, innovative ways**. Rather, they are meant to educate Main Street investors that many promoters of ICOs and cryptocurrencies are not complying with our
securities laws and, as a result, the risks are significant.""

2. ""Through the years, technological innovations have improved our markets, including through increased competition, lower barriers to entry and decreased costs for market participants. **Distributed ledger and other emerging technologies have the potential to further influence and improve the capital markets and the financial services industry**. Businesses, especially smaller businesses without efficient access to traditional capital markets, can be aided by financial technology in raising capital to establish and finance their operations, thereby allowing them to be more competitive both domestically and globally. And these technological innovations can provide investors with new opportunities to offer support and capital to novel concepts and ideas.""

3. ""Said simply,**we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising**, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and
markets.""

==================================================================================
Highlights from Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman

1. ""Traditionally, there has been a need for a trusted intermediary – for example a bank or other financial institution – to serve as a gatekeeper for transactions and many economic activities. **Virtual currencies seek to replace the need for a central authority or intermediary with a decentralized, rules-based and open consensus mechanism.  An array of thoughtful business, technology, academic, and policy leaders have extrapolated some of the possible impacts that derive from such an innovation, including how market participants conduct transactions, transfer ownership, and power peer-to-peer applications and economic systems.**""

2. ""...In fact, virtual currencies may be all things to all people: **for some, potential riches, the next big thing, a technological revolution, and an exorable value proposition; for others, a fraud, a new form of temptation and allure, and a way to separate the unsuspecting from their money.**""

3. ""The CFTC and SEC, along with other federal and state regulators and criminal authorities, will continue to work together to bring transparency and integrity to these markets and, importantly, **to deter and prosecute fraud and abuse**. These markets are new, evolving and international. As such **they require us to be nimble and forward-looking**; coordinated with our state, federal and
international colleagues; and engaged with important stakeholders, including Congress.""

4. ""**We are entering a new digital era in world financial markets. As we saw with the development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response. The evolution of these assets, their volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious examination.**""

5. ""**With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight and private sector innovation, new technologies will allow American markets to evolve in responsible ways and continue to grow our economy and increase prosperity. This hearing is an important part of finding that balance.**""

**Updates:**

**+I have seen a lot of suggestions that I am attempting to withdraw too much money. The dollar value is completely irrelevant. I have tried anywhere from $1 to $16,000 and it's the same result.**

**+Other people are calling me stupid for Wiring money. The $16,000 was not one giant wire transfer. It was a combination of ACH transfers and one wire. This happened over a two week time period where I was not buying any coin. My verification just as easily could have been mysteriously revoked before any of the money was even sent to my Coinbase account. They still knowingly took the money and are now too incompetent to remedy the verification issue. I fail to see how people can tell me I did something wrong in this scenario. Should no new money come into Cyrpto?**

**+Many people are also speculating I did something illegal. I don't have to justify myself to interwebz people but there has been nothing but long term hold and investments. if I was stupid enough to perform illicit activity with my coinbase account or other wallets...

Original Post:

I would like to start out by saying I really wish I did not have to do this, however given the circumstances I am exhausting all my options.  I apologize for the length but I need to get this out there as it maybe will help others make informed decisions about which exchanges to use. 

 I setup and fully verified a Coinbase account towards the later half of 2017. I was able to make successful ACH transfers into my USD Wallet and subsequently purchase thousands of dollars of crypto. I also had zero issues with credit card purchases. Other than not being able to get verified on GDAX so far so good. 
Fast forward to early January 2018. I decided to convert more Fiat into Crypto so I did a combination of wire and ACH transfer to what amounted to $16,000 USD. I waited for my respective coin to hit my re-buy point and went to make a large purchase only to be greeted by an error telling me that I needed to verify my SSN. This is very strange considering I had been fully verified with no issues purchasing before. Okay no problem - I enter my information which includes basics such as full name, address, SSN, occupation, etc. For whatever reason this fails along with several other attempts with varying aspects of information. After several failed attempts it locks me out for 24 hours. Over the next few days I rinse and repeat the process of varying my information and getting locked out for 24 hours. 

After around 100 failed attempts it was evident to me that no combination of my information would work. On Jan. 17 I decided to call the 800 number and speak directly to customer service. The lady I spoke with was friendly and seemed to understand as I walked her through the issue. After I had convinced her I had exhausted every possible combination of my information she recommended that I get referred to a ""specialist"" who would be able to immediately correct this issue. She said that in order to escalate the case number she would need to send me an email explaining common solutions for failed ID quiz (we already covered on the phone) as a formality and I would only need to reply back saying that I have already attempted the common solutions. Once I replied back she would be able to forward to a ""specialist"" and escalate to a ""priority 10"". Naturally I replied to the email immediately asking for this to be addressed. Here is the response I received: 

*""Hi there,
I’m sorry to hear that you are still having difficulty verifying your ID through the quiz. As I mentioned we use a third party to facilitate the quiz, and sometimes they just don’t have enough or up-to-date information.
If you’ve tried several times and still can’t successfully complete the quiz, unfortunately there may just not be enough information to verify you at this time.
You are welcome to continue trying to take the quiz as often as you’d like (there is a limit to the number of times you can try per day), as it is possible that the information may update and you could pass. You may also want to try entering different variations of your address, as that is one of the most common causes of not passing the quiz.
In some cases, this verification may be required to continue purchasing through Coinbase. However, in many cases it is not required, and you should still be able to purchase digital currency up to your daily limit with an unverified account as well as use many of Coinbase’s features for buying, selling and transferring digital currency.
In the future we may be able to implement a different method for verifying identity, but at this time we cannot manually verify your ID.
Again I’m sorry for the difficulty with the quiz. Thank you for using Coinbase.""*


WTF??? This is completely opposite of what the lady on the phone told me. Did she just tell me this to get me off the phone and now they send me an email saying ""we can't help you""? What do you mean you can't help me... you have $16,000 of my money. I immediately call back and speak to another operator asking what the deal was. She reassured me that the case was going to a ""specialist"" and would be a ""priority 10"" and sends me an email saying she is working with a specialist to address it properly. Obviously I am very perturbed at this point, however I let cooler heads prevail and try a few more days of entering my information. Of course this lead to zero success. 

I wait until Jan 24th and call back into the the 800 number to speak with an agent. After I politely explained the situation to the phone agent lo and behold they refer me to a ""specialist"" as the phone agent is unable to do anything other than verify I have a case open and it's a ""priority 10"". Before I let them hang up the phone on me and send me another email saying it's being looked at I ask if there is a way for the agent to look at the que and give me an estimate of when this will be resolved. Naturally there is no que or case# tracking system according to the agent. I also ask if I can have a number to speak with a specialist direct -- ""No you cannot speak with them"". What about email directly to a specialist? - ""No you cannot do that either"".  Can you call the specialist and speak with them? ""No we cannot do that"".  Can you call the specialist and conference me in with them? ""No we cannot do that either"". Okay so we are back to the wait for a specialist routine. The agent doubly reassures me that it will be resolved as fast as it possibly can because it is a ""priority 10"" so I reluctantly hang up the phone as it appears there is no other option. 

My mentality at this point was to call back in every day so I call back in on the 25th and essentially have a mirror image of the conversation from the 24th. At this point I realize this is going nowhere so I decide I will transfer my money back into my bank account and move to another exchange. I log into coinbase to make the transfer and WTF?!?! I can't transfer my money back into my account it came from without verifying my SSN and other information. Surely this is a joke that I have to have my SSN verified to move my own money back into the exact account it came from. At this point my mentality has moved beyond FOMO coin mania and into territory of - they have a decent amount of my money and I don't know if I will be able to get it back. 

It took every ounce of strength but I decided to take a zen-like approach and give it some more time. Absolutely zero correspondence or change in status on my Coinbase account over the next 2 weeks. On Feb 9 I made the decision to call in and make one last attempt and if the results are the same I would close my account live over the phone. The agent I spoke with gave me the same pitch of already being escalated to a ""specialist"" and there was nothing he could do further.  I really went to town and explored all options so fun facts I learned from that conversation: 1) The agent and specialist do not communicate directly 2) Apparently there is no governing authority over either of these entity's that bridges to two 3) you cannot speak with anyone above the agent, not even a supervisor? 4) You can't communicate with a specialist - but we already knew that one. 5) Specialists ""DO EXIST"" 6) the phone agent cannot view if your case has been looked at or give you an estimate of when it will be completed.  7) A phone agent will ""put you on hold"" to pretend like they are speaking with someone (not a specialist) in order to appease you into believing they are doing something constructive towards a resolution. 

 Clearly this is not getting resolved and the whole phone agent schtick is a lost cause. I immedately requested that my account be terminated and my money returned to me. I was greeted with the following ""Sir, you cannot close your account until you transfer all of your money out of your coinbase account"" Let that sink in for a moment. I cannot buy crypto, sell crypto, or transfer any USD until my SSN is verified. My SSN and information cannot be verified through the normal Coinbase verification and there is no manual way to do it nor will they provide any live customer support to work towards a resolution. I cannot close my account until all my money is transferred and there are no alternative ways to transfer money out of a Coinbase account. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F!@#$. 

Coinbase literally has my $16,000 USD held hostage as there is no solution other than ""wait for a specialist who may or may not be a real thing other than what we tell you to get you off the phone"".  I had a fully verified and functioning account - this is not an error on my end or me being pissy because I couldn't buy coin at the right time. They knowingly took $16,000 USD and then removed my verification status, have provided zero evidence of a solution, and then deny me when I make a move to close my account. I would have to believe that there are legal boundaries being crossed by denying me to close my account. I can look past the FOMO and the untold loss potential on having this amount of capital gridlocked but I cannot forgive them not even allowing me to close my account. I could even possibly make amends with this entire situation if I felt that I was receiving customer support that built trust they were actually looking for a resolution and not just telling me whatever to get me off the phone. Who knows what's really going on behind the scenes. 

My biggest problem with all of this - Coinbase certainly had ZERO issue taking the USD incoming but when it comes to the reverse its a big FU. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Recommendations? I have thought about contacting a lawyer and seeing what my options are. I also contemplated going to appropriate US authoritative bodies but I really would prefer to not bring negative attention to crypto.

# Brave Introduces Beta of Private Tabs with Tor for Enhanced Privacy while Browsing

Today we’re releasing our latest desktop browser [Brave 0.23](https://brave.com/download/) which features Private Tabs with [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), a technology for defending against network surveillance. This new functionality, currently in beta, integrates Tor into the browser and gives users a new browsing mode that helps protect their privacy not only on device but over the network. Private Tabs with Tor help protect Brave users from ISPs (Internet Service Providers), guest Wi-Fi providers, and visited sites that may be watching their Internet connection or even tracking and collecting IP addresses, a device’s Internet identifier.

Private Tabs with Tor are easily accessible from the File menu by clicking New Private Tab with Tor. The integration of Tor into the Brave browser makes enhanced privacy protection conveniently accessible to any Brave user directly within the browser. At any point in time, a user can have one or more regular tabs, session tabs, private tabs, and Private Tabs with Tor open.

The Brave browser already automatically blocks ads, trackers, cryptocurrency mining scripts, and other threats in order to protect users’ privacy and security, and Brave’s regular private tabs do not save a user’s browsing history or cookies. Private Tabs with Tor improve user privacy in several ways. It makes it more difficult for anyone in the path of the user’s Internet connection (ISPs, employers, or guest Wi-Fi providers such as coffee shops or hotels) to track which websites a user visits. Also, web destinations can no longer easily identify or track a user arriving via Brave’s Private Tabs with Tor by means of their IP address. Users can learn more about how the Tor network works by watching this [video](https://youtu.be/JWII85UlzKw).

Private Tabs with Tor default to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as the search engine, but users have the option to switch to one of Brave’s other nineteen search providers. DuckDuckGo does not ever collect or share users’ personal information, and welcomes anonymous users without impacting their search experience — unlike Google which challenges anonymous users to prove they are human and makes their search less seamless.

In addition, Brave is contributing back to the Tor network by running Tor [relays](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html). We are proud to be adding bandwidth to the Tor network, and intend to add more bandwidth in the coming months. Our relays can be viewed at: [https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:FBC2856A48705F3ED17E504F8FC89EC6433ED25D](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:FBC2856A48705F3ED17E504F8FC89EC6433ED25D)

Since Brave’s implementation of Private Tabs with Tor is currently in beta, there are still some known issues and [leaks](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Abrave+label%3Ator%2Fleakproofing&type=Issues)which we intend to fix in future versions. We welcome developer contributions to our Private Tabs with Tor feature via [GitHub](https://github.com/brave), and look forward to releasing updated versions in the coming weeks. We also plan to include support to choose exit node geolocation in the future. For users who currently require leakproof privacy, we recommend using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en), which provides much stronger and well-tested protection against websites or eavesdroppers using advanced techniques to uncover a true IP address.

We’re excited about providing our users with a new way to protect the privacy of their browsing habits, especially as more sites and advertisers are using tracking techniques and abusing user trust. Our user-first approach aims to standardize a privacy-by-default model that gives users ownership of their data and online experience, and Tor integration via Private Tabs vastly contributes to our platform.

Note: In addition to Private Tabs with Tor, Brave 0.23 features an updated icon set, refinements to the primary toolbar styling and dimensions, adjustments for tab previews, and usability improvements in the title-mode feature of the URL bar. Brave 0.23 also includes improved compatibility with Google’s suite of productivity tools, which now work better with Brave’s default Shield settings.",238

We were the first brewery in America to accept Bitcoin. We started in December of 2013. We got a lot of press because of it. The brewery is called Philadelphia Brewing Company. We had a ton of people come in with Bitcoin when we first started accepting it but it has been a long time since the last time.

We got a new P.O.S since then and haven't set up any way to receive bitcoin. Last night however, someone came in who remembered all the hype and asked me if he could pay with Bitcoin. Said it was on ""his bucket list"". I told him he was in luck. I had him send it to me and I just paid cash into the register.

After the transaction, which we were both pretty amped about as I've never received crypto in the wild and he had never sent it, I told my boss what happened and he immediately told me I was in charge of making sure we can accept Bitcoin going forward.

That's how adoption works in the real world. ",448

This subreddit has become 10x worse to read in the past couple weeks now that alts have been going crazy and new dumb money is entering. People that make money off things like TRX and XRP become so ridiculously defensive of their coins or feel the need to clog every thread about how they got in at so-and-so price with so-and-so money. How are you contributing to any discussion by posting about how you bought 100 TRX at 10c and now you've made another $10? 

Some of you make a bit of money and you go insane, growing some weird emotional attachment to your coin. Every coin subreddit is a cancerous mess of parrots shouting to each other about going to the moon, ""wish I bought earlier."" No actual discussion or useful information, just ""we're all gonna be rich!""

Just take a second and consider whether what you're posting is actually worthwhile, or are you just making a bit of fast money for the first time in your life and want to brag about the $100 you made today in [random chitcoin]. I mean, go to any thread and look at the animosity in it. ""FUDDERS!"" ""I'm laughing to the bank."" 

Most of you probably think you are some noble altruists, money would never corrupt, and you make $100 and go insane. Just stop.

Now its around 50% down and those people must be shitting bricks. And what do you guys do? Get busy making fun of them and making us look like a bunch of assholes rather than a helpful gateway to this developing market.

Right now, most people think we're just a bunch of kids that use cryptos to buy drugs. So with sentiments like this showing up, we look like immature dumbasses. We are setting the wrong example when other people browse through and what they see is that we're busy making fun of people losing money

I started participating when the Sub was a lot smaller and didn't see much of this before. So chances are it's a lot of you that are new here that are resorting to this behavior. So stop behaving like it's your baby and other newcomers are just suckers. Congratulate them on the investment and help them ride the tide. We're still in the early stages.

I'm kindly asking to knock it off. Whether you like it or not, we're being watched and judged for shit like this.

EDIT: To those of you trying to educate me that this is normal shit in Crypto, yes I know that and I'm not freaking out here. What I'm saying is that for people who just got in the game and haven't seen this volatility before, it's gonna be hell. It's a big drop at 50%. Those kinds of numbers during 2008 made people kill themselves. I'm not trying to be the thought police here, I believe in freedom of speech...I'm just asking to be more considerate in what's posted on here, use your right wisely. You never know if someone who's lost big reads this and you bring him/her down even more.

EDIT 2: thanks u/Conflixx for putting my point into better context than I did myself :)

> The point of OP though is the fact that it seems like new people who just started with cryptocurrencies, as did I just start about 5-6 mo ths ago, are making fun of people who only just jumped the gun at it's ATH right before the market crashed. People who started when I did probably more then doubled their investment because of the amazing december bull run, those are the guys who're posting this bullshit all the time now. I tend to stay away from those memes, I mean.... You might just push someone over the edge to kill himself because he basically got himself into trouble by investing to much money.

[Full blog post with all the tables](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xxromn)

tl;dr - Thanks to some good news out of China, October produced gains which snapped a three month losing streak. $1000 investment in Top Ten cryptos on January 1st, 2018 is now worth about $192. **Bitcoin** maintains overall leader position followed by **Litecoin** then **Ethereum.**  Take the two Top Ten experiments together, I'm down -21%.

\*\*NOTE\*\* - I usually like to release the two posts a day apart, but I'll be spacing out the Top Ten 2018 and the Top Ten 2019 reports a bit more as readers have mentioned they've been removed by the mods (no offence taken, mods - the content is quite similar, I assume the posts are being removed because they're seen as  identical. \*\*END NOTE\*\*

# The Experiment:

Instead of hypothetically tracking cryptos, I made an actual $1000 investment, $100 in each of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of the 1st of January 2018. Think of it as a lazy man's Index Fund (no weighting or rebalancing), less technical, more fun (for me at least), and hopefully still a proxy for the market as a whole - or at the very least an interesting snapshot of the 2018/2019 crypto space. I’m trying to keep it simple and accessible for beginners and those looking to get into crypto but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet.

I have also started a [parallel project:](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-nine-xyqkqe) on January 1st, 2019, I repeated the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) into the new Top Ten cryptos as of January 1st *2019*. Spoiler alert: the 2019 Experiment makes for much happier reading.

# The Rules:

Buy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies on January 1st, 2018. Run the experiment two years. Hold only. No selling. No trading. Report monthly. Compare loosely to the [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-nine-xyqkqe).

# Month Twenty-Two - Down 81%

Thanks to some positive news out of China, October decisively broke a three month losing streak for the 2018 Top Ten portfolio. All cryptos in the experiment were either up or flat this month, a welcome change from summer's downward trend.

# Ranking and October Winners and Losers

Although the market as a whole gained, a few of our 2018 Top Ten coins had trouble keeping up. **IOTA** and **NEM** each dropped two places to #18 and #27, respectively. **Dash** slid three slots, and now teeters on the edge of the Top Twenty. On the positive side **Bitcoin Cash** gained one position in the rankings, climbing to the four spot.

*October Winners* \- **Bitcoin Cash** rebounded nicely after a dismal September finishing +29% up on the month. **Ripple** and **Stellar** had solid months as well, ending October at +16% and +14% respectively.

*October Losers* \- Only **IOTA** lost value this month, down -1%. Along with **NEM** and **Dash**, the three were basically flat in October.

For those keeping score, here is tally of which coins have the most monthly wins and loses during the first 22 months of this experiment. Most monthly wins (5): **Bitcoin**. Most monthly loses (5): **Stellar**. All cryptos have at least one monthly win. The only two coins never to lose a month? **Bitcoin** and **Dash**.

# Overall update – Bitcoin far ahead of peers. Four worst performers down over -90% each, NEM still in basement.

**Bitcoin** is still miles ahead of the pack maintaining a *40+ percentage point lead* over second place **Litecoin** and third place **Ethereum**. This isn't even the widest lead **Bitcoin** has held since I started the experiment nearly two years ago: August 2019's +50% lead is still the record.

Looking through my past reports, poor **NEM** has been stuck in the basement all year. Since January 2019 is has been the experiment's worst overall performer. **NEM** is currently down -96% followed by **Cardano**, **Dash**, and **IOTA** all down over -90% since January 1st, 2018. My initial $100 investment in **NEM** is worth just $4.49.

40% of the cryptos that started 2018 in the Top Ten have dropped out, specifically **NEM, Dash, IOTA**, and **Cardano**. They have been replaced by **EOS, Binance Coin, Tether,** and **BTCSV**.

# Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

Breaking a three month losing streak, crypto ended October in positive territory, up about +$26B by month's end. The overall market cap is sitting around the $248B mark, rebounding to September 2019 levels. Since January 2018, the total market cap is down -57%.

If you're looking for a silver lining, followers of my [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-nine-xyqkqe) will note that there has been an increase of +74% in total crypto market cap since the beginning 2019.

# Bitcoin dominance:

**Bitcoin** dominance ticked down slightly in October, but no major shift from last month. For context, the range since the beginning of the experiment in January 2018 has been quite wide: a high of 70% in September 2019 and a low of 33% in February 2018.

# Overall return on investment from January 1st, 2018:

After three straight months of loses, the portfolio gained a modest $17 in October. If I cashed out today, my $1000 initial investment would return $192, down nearly -81%.

The 2019 Top Ten Experiment is doing a bit better. If I cashed that experiment out today, that $1,000 initial investment would return $1,387, a +39% gain. Full October report to come.

Taken together, here's the bottom bottom line: **after a $2000 investment in both the 2018 and the 2019 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my portfolios would be worth $1,579.**

That's down about -21%.

# Implications/Observations:

As always, the experiment's focus of solely holding the Top Ten Cryptos continues to be a losing approach. While the overall market is down -%57 from January 2018, the cryptos that began 2018 in the Top Ten are down **-81%** over the same period.

At no point in this experiment has this investment strategy been successful: the initial 2018 Top Ten have under-performed each of the twenty-two months compared to the market overall.

I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The S&P 500 is now up +15.2% since the beginning of 2018. My initial $1k investment into crypto would have yielded about +$152 had it been redirected to the S&P.

# Conclusion:

Thanks to the news out of China, October ended up breaking the streak of three consecutive months of downward movement for crypto. Again, this shows that unpredictability is the norm in crypto: we seemed on track to continue the downward trend until the end of the year. With two months left in the year, will the October gains hold?

Thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment. I hope you’ve found it helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.

I strongly believe a great deal of these ""news"" articles have been brigaded or vote-manipulated.

""Russia investing in bitcoin = fake news."" Absolutely, I do not disagree with that. Taking a completely non-influential Russian's political beliefs on Twitter and spinning a news article on it - that's some bull shit. Conflicting articles on the legality of cryptocurrency in India, this is all dog shit.

If cryptocurrency is to be taken seriously, if it is to be the ""way of the future"", then its advent would only be accelerated by destroying websites that are profiting off of the fringes of the success of cryptocurrency. 

EDIT: If a political figure, political body, celebrity, or well-known entrepreneur / business owner (Elon Musk, Winklevoss Twins, a state senator, a massive city's mayor, a country's president, etc.) have something to say, usually they'll say it on Twitter and it's better for us to see what they say there than read some news source that's going to make 1000 words out of what these public figures can say in 280 characters on social media.

EDIT 2: While I won't list any specific articles, I suppose **some, purely 100% speculative** articles would be just fine. For example, if someone maintains a blog on Medium and investigates the topic of a particular bitcoin ETF, or if someone runs a wordpress blog and entertains the idea of banks offering cryptocurrency custody solutions, or if somebody cites real sources from real people without trying to jump to B.S. conclusions, I'm all for it! I just don't want to see something that says, ""BAKKT is coming online. So now president Trump supports bitcoin!"" in the headline.",181

Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge extra fees to access sites, apps, and send cryptocurrency. This is a direct threat to the growth of the cryptomarket.","Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services.

These changes could severely stifle growth in the still-developing cryptomarket. With touchy topics like money laundering, darknet markets, and anonymous coins like Monero, we could see ISPs blocking or heavily throttling cryptocurreny transactions in the near future.

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

Today I thought I would give back to the community, as you guys have helped me so much in the past. I'm mostly a lurker but I have made a lot of money last year from analysis of low marketcap coins by myself and by the community (you) so here’s one from me for free to you guys. And yes, this is a ‘shill’ post and I do have quite some money in AMB, but it’s not baseless, trust me.

Ambrosus (Marketcap $76.663.725 USD, potential x5 to ~$350.000.000)

‘’Combining high-tech sensors, blockchain protocol and smart contracts, we are building a universally verifiable, community-driven ecosystem to assure the quality, safety & origins of products.’’ Basically Ambrosus is another supply chain coin, think of it as the European VEN with a great team and already on Binance.

**Problems it’s solving:**

* Counterfeiting of goods (e.g drugs) counterfeited medicine is a big problem, especially in developing nations. Consumers don’t know if their drugs are legitimate from a licensed factory with the right safety standards or mixed with something for profit.
* Cross-information logistical problems. Companies such as manufacturing companies maintain their data on their own database or spreadsheet, this makes it difficult to share information with other companies or authorities.
* Customer purchasing blindly. Right now, we don’t know anything about the products we buy. Especially in developing nations where there is little regulation and oversight. We don’t know where the products came from, how they were produced, and if they were tampered with (counterfeiting)

**How will they do this?**

* Sensor hardware (making their own in Switzerland) for gathering data on products and verifying it on the blockchain
* cross-data management with standardized data architecture and API’s
* Developer tools and platforms, everyone can build a third party app using Ambrosus to verify data including private business apps.

There is also a huge pharma partnership rumoured that could be the catalyst, Gavin Wood the co-founder of Ethereum is an advisor, extremely qualified team in their respective fields. Right now they have partnerships with the Swiss coffee Alliance and the United nations 10YFP programme. There has also been a lot of talk about partnerships still under NDA.",189

I am not an Ethereum developer, just someone who uses Google reasonably well. I am also a stakeholder in ETH. With those facts in mind, consider the following post to be thoughtful speculation, based on my current understanding of both projects that are not so far away from the truth. Hopefully, this thread won’t get downvoted to the gutters of this sub.

&nbsp;

Let’s start by explaining what sharding is and what does it means for Ethereum. Sharding is a method of increasing the number of transactions a blockchain can process. Designed to be used “on-chain”, multiple network computers divide the transaction workload between them, allowing significantly more to occur within the same period of time. At its current state, Ethereum can only handle an average of 15 tps(transactions per second), which is very low for a platform that has a large and growing community. In the other hand, we have a platform like EOS, which is Ethereum based, that when stress tested on a decentralized network reached 18.000 tps.

&nbsp;

Ethereum, in my view, has taken on the biggest problem it could face, and that is scalability. It’s unclear if it can be solved in a practical sense. What’s worse is that the broader Ethereum community believes that Ethereum already has the solutions or is close to having them. Ethereum, in the current form, works at small scale and by design breaks at large scale. Every new user/node is adding a state for every other user/node at a rate that is not sustainable in a distributed system. Speaking at Deconomy conference in Seoul, South Korea last month, Buterin himself stated that Ethereum applications are ""screwed"" by current scaling challenges.

&nbsp; 

Ethereum, by design, wants to put all complexity in the network. This is the exact opposite design choice that the end-to-end principle made for the Internet. Complexity is not only an enemy of security (as seen in the DAO attack and running turing-complete code) but is also an enemy of building scalable networks.

&nbsp;

>“There are two things, you have quantity of transactions and quality of transactions and you might be able to increase the quantity of a certain type of transaction by sharding but you're not going to be able to do the quality of transactions that DApp developers actually need, and you're not going to be able to do so with the performance and latency that you need, because, as soon as you’re sharding now you have to have all these extra delays in the confirmation while you wait for the other shards to catch up and the communication overhead really really slows things down, so I don't really see sharding as a viable solution” - Dan Larimer

Charlie lee is nothing short of a bitconnect scammer.

He pretends to be a ""nice guy"", he uses his persona for personal gains while trying to shift focus out of him through hating over other projects and/or using infantile memes to gather attention from young audiences..

You should first start here: https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/coinbase-insider-trading-litecoin-edition-be64ead3facc

There are some pretty disturbing ""coincidences"" there.

Charlie not only started LTC opportunistically copying BTC and gluing together some pieces of code (that he managed to make worse than the originals - such as asic resistance), but he also have being absolutely flippant in everything he says about bitcoin.

He surfed the wave of being ""silver to bitcoin's gold"" since 2011. Suddenly, after managing to get listed in coinbase, he left it right after to ""work on LTC"" (all that time LTC had really near zero development). What was his work? To implement segwit, that was the only concrete thing that happened to LTC and it is highly debatable if that is even good. That's right, from 2011 to 2017, the only thing that happened to LTC was copying segwit from bitcoin core repo.

After he surfed the wave of ""being a test bed for these awesome technologies"", all of a sudden these ""awesome technologies"" apparently were not that awesome anymore, so he dumped all of his LTC.

Lets draw a timeline here:

2011 -- LTC is born from a major copy&paste event: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47417.0 (notice that he edited the OP up to june 2014 to make it look better - hover over the date)

Up to 2017 **nothing** really happens, except mining. LTC is silver to BTC's gold, and LTC will succeed iff BTC succeeds. That's the narrative.

April, 2017, charlie lee leaves coinbase after he manages to list LTC there. LTC was DEAD and suddenly spikes violently in price right before listing is confirmed.

Until august, charlie lee only shills about LTC, segwit, LN and blockstream related things, posting infantile animes and cartoons. Goes to a TV show and says that LTC is like a token, for fun, embarrass himself. LTC community gets pissed and he replies to them saying that *it is not his responsibility to pump their holdings*.

Surprise! After 1st of august, he starts to slander BCH, call it a scam, getting pretty vocal and tweeting more shit than anyone can possibly tolerate and says that ""he is done tweeting"". Then he deletes several of his tweets. But comes back a couple of days after this bluff. A guy who doesn't stick to anything he says, never.

Suddenly his tweets are talking down BTC now, and shilling LTC alone, contradicting what he said to his followers in reddit, that he wouldn't shill LTC - remember: for over 5 years all he did was cheer-leading BTC and say ""hey I'm the same but I'm the silver version"". He continues to badmouth BCH without nothing to back it up. Even luke-jr, BTC core dev, gets pissed with him and calls his shitcoin out (https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/923414550157938688), saying that he would rather use BCH (https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/923435699084431360).

Charlie was often posting pictures of him with ""HODL"" shirts and etc. There is scant content to be found besides memes and other crap like that. Clear shilling.

December 2017, charlie lee dumps ALL his LTC he accumulated over 6 years of mining at the top of the hype (http://archive.is/l6Z6u). Not a part, but all, without further notice. I mean, there is nothing wrong in trading, but if you are a public figure and founder of the project, you gotta observe at least some responsibilities from a moral stand point. 

The LEADER of a project and public figure can't simply dump everything after shilling it to hundreds of thousands of suckers, this is criminal level.

He then poses as a ""nice guy"", saying it was because of ""conflict of interests"" (supposedly the interest of getting rich after the pump and the interest of keeping hold of a future-less shitcoin.)

He also says he was so good that he donated part to LTC foundation, he is such a boy-scout! It turns out that he ""donated"" money to himself, since he controls the foundation, and DIRECTLY to his pals over there (confirmed by one of them). This much is of course for money launder (not defending taxes, but just stating the obvious.)

You think that bitconnect is a scam because it promised high returns and then bitconnecters sold on their supporters their bitconnect tokens. Also because of that carlos mattos ridiculous videos.

Fair enough, but charlie lee also conned people into buying LTC. His tweets are maybe not so obviously ridiculous like carlos mattos, but they are pure shill. His tweets display him with HODL messages, moon memes and other shill stuff. He then sells without telling anyone and invents some gullible crap to divert attention, also using FUD against BCH and other crypto to divert attention. 

Who bought LTC? Charlie Lee followers in tweeter, his own community, and his reddit subscribers!! The listing of it in coinbase and other places, where he had obvious influence, was the pump he needed to eventually get rid of his coins. I know 8 months seem like a long time in crypto, but for a waiting of 6 years, it is really a very short time.

Now, the shameless lee is shilling Raiblocks/Nano. Let me be clear, I have technical criticism over Nano (for instance, laid down some [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80z0xa/after_selling_his_ltc_charlie_lee_is_now_shilling/duzrtbt/) ), but I do not think the project launched as a scam, not really. I just think it doesn't work for the reasons pointed in the link above.

But you should be aware that now charlie is involved and using his social farms to down vote, censor and shill. He admitted *having nano*:

>Charlie Lee: ""Disclaimer: I own some NANO"": >https://web.archive.org/web/20180301053624/https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/968931625001140224

Now, let's be reasonable: isn't it **very strange** that this guy sold all coins of his own project, then when he thinks people already forgot he goes to a totally unrelated and (in principle) *rival* project to talk about it? And that, only after he got zillions of votes, reddit gold and visualizations, he says ""hey, I have some nano, just saying"". 

WTF?! Does this seems like a healthy market to any of you? Do we really need this low level of manipulation to make money trading? I don't think so, we should call out the shit and we depend on good projects succeeding to go to the next level of adoption.

So I'm doing my part: be aware of the scam and trade carefully.

Monero is an ASIC-resistant coin. Recently, ASICs went online their network. So they hardforked their algorithm. But now, they're trying a completely new method of PoW: RandomJS. Instead of solving hashing algorithms, Monero will now be mined by solving random Javascript programs.

Great right!?!?! You can't develop an ASIC that computes Javascript code faster than the just-in-time bytecode optimization algorithm in Javascript's engine, and you can't create a program that executes Javascript faster because it's literally had the worlds greatest minds try to optimize it.

IGNORNING the fact that it's *Javascript*, which is flimsy as fuck and has gaping security flaws, IGNORING the fact that an FPGA can implement the just-in-time bytecode optimizer, there is a GAPING FLAW in the RandomJS implementation.

(For the technical users, I'm about to explain what's wrong with [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/kJqR3FG.png))

If you read that, you'll notice something oddly peculiar; **THEY REMOVED THE NEED FOR THE JUST IN TIME BYTECODE OPTIMIZATION**

That's fucking right, they REMOVED THE ENTIRE POINT OF USING JAVASCRIPT by only running the generated code once, because now a user that does NOT choose to optimize their code will have an advantage.

Which means: ASICs can develop on the Monero network. Smart programmers will fuck over the Monero network. Javascript will now be the BACKBONE OF THE MONERO NETWORK.

So yeah. [Here's the source code](https://github.com/tevador/RandomJS) if anybody is interested. I'm moving to Dogecoin, where at least Đ1 = Đ1

*****

^^^^^^.

##CLARIFICATIONS

>How about explaining why you think it doesn't work? In the OP, I see nothing more concrete than sheer incredulity.

Because you have randomly generated JavaScript code. Eventually, this JavaScript code will have to do some math. You offload the math to an ASIC and bring back the answer, you are going to be miles ahead of any CPU

>I have 2 monero, can someone tell me if this is moon or doom?

##EDIT: [It is *POSSIBLE* that I'm mistaken](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/938t8c/monero_are_you_trying_to_kill_yourself/e3bnbag/?context=3) due to how the JIT optimizer works. If this protocol has any flaw, it would be in how that functions. With that said, JavaScript was not built to do this kind of shit, so it would be a hefty bet.

Reading through Plair's Token Offering, raises red flags. Why on earth would an esports company that hasn't established themselves and has no following want $30 million for 25&#37; of the tokens. This leaves 75&#37; tokens left for themselves and this would give a value of $120 million for the entire project.  
Out of the 25&#37; of tokens that are sold, half of them goes to large holders like whales who get highly favorable bonuses. For the few of us that are X node holders, there is a requirement of 1500 VET just to be able to participate.

You would expect that Sunny Lu would have chose a better project as VeChain Thor's first ICO on the newly launched platform. Sunny likes the big companies and I mean big companies like DNV GL, Fortune 500 companies, government backed companies and most importantly a company that already has a working product. 

On Plair's advisory board, one person stands out, Ray NG. [https://hk.linkedin.com/in/ray\-k\-w\-ng\-esports](https://hk.linkedin.com/in/ray-k-w-ng-esports) Upon inspection, Ray NG is an ""Assistant Manager, Esports, TW/HK & SEA at Blizzard Entertainment"" and he has only been there for 7 months. This guy is very small and probably does not have much authority. This is not impressive.

Cmon Sunny, as your first ICO to the VeChain Thor platform, I would have expect it to be a more promising project that doesn't raise huge red flags and a project that surely isn't worth $120 million from the start given that theres relatively few details.

It's a coin with a lack of notion of confirmations/finality. Your coins are never really confirmed.,"I'm sure I'll be accused of spreading FUD, so some brief notes about my bio:

 * I've been involved in cryptocurrency consensus and scalability research since 2011; I was the first to propose sidechains and sharding, back in 2011 when very few people were concerned about scaling
 * I co-authored two academic, peer-reviewed papers on consensus, on is called Proof-of-Activity, another called ""Cryptocurrencies without proof-of-work"" (Proof-of-consensus)
 * I identified weaknesses in Peercoin consensus algorithm back when it was released in 2012, which results in several consensus algorithm changes; I also pointed out flaws in Mastercoin, which led to changes in how development process is organized
 * so yeah, I ""spread FUD"" occasionally, but my FUD is well-justified

Now about RaiBlocks. I do not want to do a full review and identify actual exploitable weaknesses. I just want to point some red flags which I discovered why reading the whitepaper. Whether these problems are actually exploitable is another question...

So let's start from the fact that there are two white papers. When you google ""RaiBlocks white paper"", you can find the old one, [here](https://coss.io/documents/white-papers/raiblocks.pdf).

it defines a concept of confirmations. Some quotes:

 * When a node receives a send block to an account it controls, it first runs the
confirmation procedure followed by adding the block into its ledger.
 * ... voting nodes will sign the block with their voting key and publish a
confirm message. **A message is considered confirmed if there are no conflicting
blocks and a 50% vote quorum has been reached.** If there is a conflicting block the
node will wait 4 voting periods, 1 minute total, and confirm the winning block.

This is a clear definition of confirmation. There might be some subtle issues in it, but in normal case this algorithm will work. But it's, basically, a fantastically inefficient version of proof-of-stake, which requires orders of magnitude more bandwidth then necessary. Note that this paper doesn't describe delegation, so you have all nodes voting for each transaction, thus wasting millions time more traffic then necessary.

I think at some point Colin LeMahieu realised that he implemented a shitty version of PoS which doesn't scale, and tried to make it scale. You can find [the new version of paper](https://raiblocks.net/media/RaiBlocks_Whitepaper__English.pdf) on Raiblocks.net web site. It's much more sciency looking. It seems that Colin was desperate to improve the protocol without changing the architecture. So you see some mental contortions. First:

>  Since agreements in RaiBlocks are reached quickly, on the order of milliseconds to
seconds, we can present the user with two familiar categories
of incoming transactions: settled and unsettled. Settled transactions
are transactions where an account has generated receive
blocks. Unsettled transactions have not yet been incorporated
in to the receiver’s cumulative balance. This is a replacement
for the more complex and unfamiliar confirmations metric in
other cryptocurrencies.

So Colin tells us that we do not need a notion of ""confirmed"" and can use a notion of ""settled"" instead. So what's the difference?

Well, Colin is honest with us: settled doesn't mean confirmed. It only means that _your_ node have acknowledged reception of coins, but that doesn't mean that coins are finally yours. There's no notion of finality of this system. Delegates can replace blocks with their votes on any time, so your money might disappear weeks after it was settled.

Without explicit voting on every transaction, you don't have a notion of confirmation or finality.

Another red flag:

> ... a fork must be the result of
poor programming or malicious intent (double-spend) by the
account’s owner. Upon detection, a representative will create a vote referencing
the block ˆbi
in it’s ledger and broadcast it to the network.

So conflicts, or forks, are resolved through voting. But how are they detected?

If a node can identify a conflict, it might be able to resolve it. But detection of discrepancy is one of major topics of consensus.

E.g. suppose Alice's node received version 1 of a block, while Bob's node received version 2. If they do communicate, they won't be aware of the conflict.

So how are conflicts detected in the RaiBlocks? The paper doesn't define this, but it mentions that block messages are sent between nodes, so a node can detect conflict when it receives different versions of blocks from different peers.

So conflict detection is _possible_ in this model, but is it reliable? There's no evidence for that.

In theory, if you can guarantee that every message is delivered, you can achieve reliable conflict detection. But in practice, networks are not reliable. And you do not want full connectivity anyway (each node talking with each other node is fantastically expensive). And on top of that, RaiBlocks uses UDP network protocol, which is unreliable. There's no guarantee of message delivery. And if messages are lost, conflict might be undetected, thus Alice's node will think she received coins from Bob while the rest of the network will think otherwise.

This topic is not discussed in the paper.

RaiBlocks, not having a proper blockchain, also lacks a way to compare state of two nodes. In Bitcoin you only need to compare the latest hash: if hash is the same, then nodes are in perfect sync. But in RaiBlocks you have multiple ""blockchains"" for each account, so basically you have to compare state of every account to check that you are in sync. This is incredibly wasteful.

So, to summarize, I'd describe RaiBlocks as ""UDP coin"". It might work quite well if network conditions are good and messages are delivered. It can even tolerate some degree of packet loss. But there's no proof that it works in all conditions, in fact, the paper avoids the topic. There's no notion of confirmation. You never know if you received coins or not. There are probably many conditions in which the system would fail.

I'm not interested in finding an actual failure, it's not a good use of my time. So treat the above as an opinion of a guy who has significant knowledge about consensus algorithm upon reading the Raiblocks papers. Feel free to ignore it. :)

I'm only a 14 months new to crypto currency so I wasn't around all these other years when people talked about it, and came up with ideas,

Keep in mind, Diaspora was revolutionary. I even if one of these guys weren't satoshi, Diaspora might have been the creation if not one one of creations that sprung blockchain into what it is today. 

First I must explain what Diaspora was/is.  

##They were the first fully decentralized social network##

Copied from my other post...

They were everything crypto currencies were without using crypto. They had Dapps built off their protocol such as ""The Federation"". Diaspora was complete , and released 3 years before the ethereum crowdsale. A full version was released in 2010.

They were the first decentralized social network run off PODS(Nodes). Best part? They only needed $200,000 from kickstarter. Not billions like some overhyped cryptos need and don't even have a working product, but that's a conversation for another time.

Anyway,

**what happened to diaspora?**

The co-founder Ilya Zhitomirskiy died suddenly of suicide at age 22. Theories were ""Pressures related to Diaspora"". Conspiracies say although Mark Zuckerberg donated to their kickstarter, he was responsible for llya's death because Diaspora was a threat to take down Facebook. Something about the donation being a decoy to steer attention away. Again, that's a conversation for another time.

Long story short they find it odd someone who was so motivated with the world of opportunity at his feet would just fold under pressure enough to commit suicide after most of the work was done.

##""Our distributed design means no big corporation will ever control Diaspora. Diaspora will never sell your social life to advertisers, and you won’t have to conform to someone’s arbitrary rules or look over your shoulder before you speak""##

Diaspora is still being used today. Said to have about a million users , and about 5000 total PODS(Nodes) registered with some inactive.

There were a few ways you can join. Open signups by joining in on someone's pod if they left signups open. Running your own pod that dealt specifically with just your profile, or hosting other users at a central location.

Right now it seems to be an underground dedicated community just like open IRC was.

As much as some people don't like to believe ""stories"" , you have to give credit where credit is due because we all have Diaspora to thank for laying down the ground work for all the crypto platforms we have today. Including Ethereum.

BitCoin opened the door for using crypto currencies, Diaspora proved BitCoin right.

**Diaspora: An open source decentralized P2P protocol for social networking.**

**Founders**: Ilya Zhitomirskiy, Dan Grippi, Max Salzberg, and Raphael Sofaer

**Taken from Wiki**

*""The word diaspora is Greek in origin and refers to a scattered or dispersed population.""*

DiasporaFoundation.org

Back to who satoshi is. 

So this guy 

Ilya Zhitomirskiy died in November 2011.  Apparently from too much pressure over Diaspora he killed himself, right.    6 months earlier in April,  it was claimed *""Satoshi is never coming back""*.       

If you look deeper into what lead up to his suicide , you will find it was around about a year prior in 2010 he started getting worried, and paranoid he was going to be killed.  He told his peers he felt someone was following him around, and he started coming up with off the wall conspiracies, and the project is too much for him.  Apparently he was talked into taking a break a few months before he died.(around,the same time official Satoshi was said to have his last words.   

He wanted to quit but was talked out of it, It wasn't until after he kiled himself (or so the reports say)  that his peers started believing his rants. It was thought Facebook CEO Mark Z sent out a strategic hit on him because Decentralized Diaspora was a threat to take over Facebook.  



So get this.  

** In order to be Satoshi , you would obviously have to understand how blockchain works, and how to code it.**

He knew how for sure.  His Diaspora speaks for itself. 

**A lot of people think Satoshi was russian including the NSA**

He's Russian.

Satoshi started to Disappear around the same time Zhitomirskiy went cuckoo before apparently killing himself .   diaspora is still running today because its decentralized, and BitCoin is still running today because it's decentralized.   

This makes total sense to me. 

If not him, then someone close to him.

More wiki: 
The project was founded by Dan Grippi, Maxwell Salzberg, Raphael Sofaer and Ilya Zhitomirskiy, students at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. The group received funding in excess of $200,000 via kicktarter. A consumer alpha version was released on 23 November 2010.

I was hodling throughout and I still am.

I read 5 + hours in terms of crypto, and crypto alone, since I found out about it.

At this point I see people are about give up on crypto and even knowingly that it is the future, are breaking apart from the losses and cannot handle it, everyone has someone close to him, telling him: this can be a scam and go to zero.

NOW LISTEN UP!

I've been reading all kinds of news about crypto since last November.
I can promise you that previously the bad sounded really fucking bad, and the good were just a coing goes on a large exchange and prices were pumping like MAD!

Now the negative news are exactly: ""inser name"" who has a stake against crypto due to stock market, banks or whatever, says: i dont see a future in this and it will fail.

People sell, this guy's institution is buying - leveraging branding and the power of the media!

This has been happening and people have been manipulated, but know the actual situation has changed, now the good news are something like:

""Inser name of world leader in X industry jumps in cryptocurrencies and starts testing operations with the blockchaon""

""Largest stock exchange in the world has been collaborating with Microsoft and Starbucks in stealth mode for 14 months, to open a crypto exchange, in NOVEMBER! 

Two freaking months from now,

This is the time when the SEC gave as next date to decide the fate of the CBOE ETF, which I can tell you, WILL BE APPROVED, but the actual time-frame is 30 september until 22nd of February.

Banks are abusing their power to press crypto now just before it jumps up!!!

I know you read about it and they buy while saying shit about crypto, stacking up hardcore ballz deep!

Do not be a coward who lost money, crypto family I urge you to assemble!

We are winning, we must assemble and work as one, stop posting memes of how bad shit is, becauee the people who might join and invest to break those supports, the new people will generate fear if they see it!

Be a Champion of Crypto and do not let anyone take what is yours!

I'm not very technical / still working on understanding some concepts, but it took me about 2 hours with some googling to understand how the xrp network works and what the future may hold. The Consensus Protocol +  Independent Validator Servers is an fantastic concept.

TDLR: Can someone please prove me wrong, or offer counter arguments to my conclusions:

1. It appears to me like XRP is an extremely fast, efficient way to transfer money from different currencies, with no drawbacks.
2. It appears to be deflationary, since a small amount of tokens are forever deleted after transactions.
3. It appears to be more decentralized than bitcoin, with a plan in place that will within years have it so the ripple foundation can no longer block consensus votes for changes to the xrp chain and more independent validator servers will be added.
4. Why wouldn't I use this over Nano, BTC, Stellar, and similar coins for sending and receiving small payments?

Thus, Bitcoin works, its complicated, but it essentially seems to be working as designed and described in the White Paper and by Satoshi before he left the project. 

Why fix whats not broken (and why not allow Bitcoin to scale on chain like Satoshi designed)? That is what Bitcoin Cash is, Bitcoin before Bitcoin had ""fixed"" what was never broken. 

The Blockstream Core Team removed the ability to send a 0-confirmation (instant) tx, they removed the chain a signatures as described originally (opening up a potential new attack surface), so whatevere people want to call this new thing, it is most certainly not Bitcoin anymore. 

But, unlike a Bitcoin itself, Bitcoin code easily forks, and that is just what bitcoin did before the Core team managed to run the Legacy chain into the ground with high fees and slow txs. 

Bitcoin Cash is nothing more that Bitcoin. Legacy Bitcoin Core however has morphed into a new project that bares little resemblance to the original vision of Bitcoin. ",81

From the thousands of coins around I believe there is probably less than 20 cryptocurrency projects that are actually trying to make something real and useful, that will actually accrue value meaningfully in the future.

When the top ten or twenty coins are this terrible, it's telling us that investors are still batshit crazy and have no idea what they are buying.

1. This controversial issue will define the Nano community for months, if not years of the vital time that Nano is seeking to gain market share. All BitGrail related updates will bring all the bad feeling out of the woodwork and it won't be resolved any time soon.

2. Many early adopters are now completely disenfranchised, especially given the community reaction of blaming those who lost funds when full withdrawal was impossible for many. These are the people who would have helped to drive a large amount of growth and adoption.

3. Institutional investment and adoption will suffer. When companies and organisations look for which technology to adopt they will see the mess that's occurred and how 12% of the circulating supply was stolen. How it happened and the resulting consequences will be a stain on Nano's reputation for years to come.

I see people comparing thid to MtGox, but there are important dissimilarities: MtGox was far less than 10% of circulating supply, and it happened in a different time when the market was less mature and BTC had very few alternatives.

For the reasons above I believe this could be a devastating event for the entire currency. This is my analysis, and I have no solutions to offer. I know holders will downvote and cry FUD but I'd much rather see the substance of what I've written disputed in a thoughtful and intellectually honest way.",98

Buyers beware. Don't get screwed over. You've been warned.,"This isn't my original research, but it's incredibly important for our crypto community to understand the truth. Here it is:

I came to the same conclusion when I did a extended research in Chinese and on Baidu (Chinese google).
Full disclosure I’ve made significant profit from WTC, got in at $1.50, exited at $6.50~. The main reason I exited is because I found a lot of red flags after my research. I was trying to figure out whether it’s a legit project and whether i should keep my investment long term.

From my research, I found the following red flags:

All the news about Waltonchain in Chinese are of the exact same format. They are either on no name website or blog posts on legit websites (Sina, etc). The only legit source I saw was tech.china.com1. I am still unclear how they get china.com to publish. I don’t know too much about how legit china,com is.

I did a extended research on the team members. For the co-founder 许芳呈, who is supposed to be the VP of supply chain of Septwolves, well he’s no where to be found on any Chinese search engine. There’s no record of him at all. Most other team members are either no where to be found, or they have the same generic news article from no name websites.

There’s no work repo so far. That’s extremely problematic. There’s nothing to show that they are on track of making any software development progress.

Jingjiang competition: This is the final red flag that confirm my theory of Walton being a scam. I am originally from Fuzhou, Fujian. The same province where Jingjiang competition is held.

Take a look at this site and look at the reward of the competition (highest price is 300k RMB = 50K USD, Walton claimed they won 1M USD in funding):
https://www.ad-ci.org/2017-fujian-industrial-design-compe37

Now take a look at this site, which listed all the project finalists for the competition (Ask a Chinese friend to translate it):
http://www.52jingsai.com/article-3894-1.html30
There’s nothing even remotely related to Walton Chain…

To be completely honest, i am very disappointed about my research. I wished WTC was legit. I wanted to believe in its idea of combining blockchain technology with IOT and supply chain application. However, after my research, I can no longer be comfortable with keeping my money in the project. I took my profit. My best advise for you guys is do you own research on top of what I’ve discovered. Ask a Chinese friend to help you translate and verify the legitimacy of any news sources you found on Walton chain. My goal is not to spread FUD but bring out legitimate concerns about this project. I really hope you guys don’t get screwed over by the scam.",39

Ripple has been around since 2012, like an aggressive case of  athlete’s foot that has infected your entire family. Ripple is the  earliest shitcoin to become a major cryptocurrency. Today Ripple is the  #2 cryptocurrency by market cap behind Bitcoin, despite it being a  centralized shitcoin. There are 100 billion XRP in total, and 20 billion  XRP were automatically given to the Founders of Ripple Labs, and then  they ‘gave’ the other 80 billion XRP to Ripple Labs, which is  essentially giving it to themselves.

This makes the XRP market incredibly centralized, to this day Ripple  Labs holds 59 billion XRP. XRP cannot be mined, and must be purchased  from Ripple Labs at some point. Ripple Labs dumps 1 billion XRP onto the  market every month, screwing up people dumb enough to invest in XRP,  and making Ripple Labs greasy amounts of cash. Every day Ripple Labs  must have a party where they drive new Lamborghinis into pools filled  with the finest caviar, while drinking 1,000 year old wine poolside,  since how else could they spend hundreds of millions of USD per month.  When eventually naive crypto investors buy up all 100 billion XRP, there  is nothing to stop Ripple Labs from printing more, to keep their  non-stop caviar and lambo pool parties going.

In recent news, Ripple Labs is fighting a legal battle, funded by  their tremendous income, to prove XRP is not a security. XRP is the  definition of a security, based on the SEC definition at least, and if  Ripple Labs wins this battle it will just prove that the courts can be  bought out. It would be truly wonderful if the SEC slams their boot down  on Ripple’s neck and demands retroactive penalties. Ripple and XRP have  caused innocent people to lose tens of billions of USD, and they  deserve the worst possible outcome in court.

It gets worse. [XRP does not have a blockchain](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-ripple/),  and therefore it is not even a cryptocurrency. XRP uses a system of  servers, probably entire controlled by Ripple Labs, which validate each  other.

It is totally sick that XRP is the #2 cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin,  and is a true testament to how naive crypto investors can be. So many  people say XRP is an awesome cryptocurrency, when in-fact it is not a  cryptocurrency, just a centralized database. The supply is centralized  and the technology is centralized. XRP is a shitcoin that must be  eliminated.",152

I often see people posting that NANO is superior as a payment system since it's faster and decentralized, and IOTA has the centralized coordinator which bottlenecks the network. But I've read the point of the coordinator is to protect against certain attacks that come with having free transactions, until the network is strong enough and it can be removed (theoretically). How does NANO accomplish this with no centralization?

Sadly a lot of people who invest in crypto are sheep who hardly do any research at all. My thesis is that It  takes only a few shilling post read on Reddit to trigger a buy (I have done the same, which luckily worked out). Lately I've been reading a lot of shilling towards EOS. How? Do people know who are behind the company of EOS? Do people know what kind of background they have? And if you know, how can you ever endorse such a company?

I'm of course talking about Brock Pierce. This man should be given the worst possible punishment you can imagine giving to a human being in my eyes. But you don't have to believe me, read his Wikipedia, it's directly also the reason why NOT to invest in EOS and a big reason why to BOYCOT EOS:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Pierce

For those lazy, I'm talking about this:
> Pierce retired from acting at 17 and joined as a minor partner with Marc Collins-Rector and Chad Schackley in establishing Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), which succeeded in raising $88 million in venture capital.[2] He produced its first show, a pilot for gay teenagers called Chad's World.[3] Pierce began enjoying a lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles riding the Dot-com bubble. As an 18 year old, Pierce was making $250,000 a year and held 1% of the company's shares.[4]Within three years, DEN, never having made a profit and having exhausted its venture capital, collapsed and Pierce fled the U.S. with his two co-founders when a number of former underage DEN employees made sexual misconduct allegations against them.[5][6] The three were arrested by Spanish police before being returned to the US. Though Pierce was not ultimately charged, his partner Collins-Rector was convicted on multiple counts of child enticement involving boys.

Now let's look at this once again:

> Within three years, DEN, never having made a profit and having exhausted its venture capital

And of course this:

> and Pierce fled the U.S. with his two co-founders when a number of former underage DEN employees made sexual misconduct allegations against them

Now from this point, I would advice you to watch the documentary 'An open secret'. This pretty much tells the story of 'DEN'. In the end one of the child actors took his own life. 

But wait! We aren't done yet! At least not with mr. Pierce. The wiki goes on:

> In 2013, Pierce joined brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens in founding venture capital firm Blockchain Capital (BCC) which was reported to have raised $85 million in two venture funds by October 2017.[8] Described as its managing partner, Pierce announced a $50 million Initial Coin Offering (ICO) by BCC in February 2017.[9] On its launch in June 2017, the currency was named EOS and marketed through a new vehicle called Block.one

And guess what? He actually managed to raise 50 million dollars, and EOS is now worth over a billion dollars. Not only that, they just dumped 130k ethereum a few days ago, so we KNOW they liquidated their cash, an exit scam seems so much like the logical next step. But even if EOS was legit, who in their right mind wants to support a person like Brock Pierce? 

That's why I propose we all as a community, stand strong and BOYCOT this coin. You can NOT justify investing in this coin with the knowledge I just shared. And yes I know, Mr Pierce isn't the posterboy of EOS anymore, he brought too much negative publicity after the last week show bit of James Oliver. But somehow people STILL are investing in it, so once I again, this topic has to be brought up. If a coin, that was created by a KNOWN scammer AND child molester reaches the top 10 of a certain market, what does that say about the market? It's time to dump that shit, let it burn away so we don't ever have to speak about it again.

EDIT:

Here is the link to the documentary 'an open secret':

https://vimeo.com/142444429

I know those blinded by greed and already invested in EOS will probably not even watch this (important) documentary, but those who are still in doubt, go watch it.",469

""RaiBlocks achieves consensus through a Representative system. When a user creates a new account they select a Represenative account that will vote on their behalf. By default, one of the eight Official Representatives, controlled by the RaiBlocks development teams, is selected, and most users never even realize they’re just delegated their vote.

In the event of a disputed transaction the representatives vote on which transaction is correct. The vote of each representative is weighed by the sum of the RaiBlocks in the accounts that have selected it to represent them.

Currently, the Official Representatives control 56% of the representation of all RaiBlocks, as seen here. While the development team can be trusted to run the network in an honest manner, as it’s in their own best interest to do so, that’s a dangerous amount of centralization for a cryptocurrency.

First off there is way too much cognitive dissonance taking play here. People only see and read what they want to see and read, they don't take a look at opposing views. My opinion is that crypto is a bubble, but if I'd post it here I would get massively downvoted.

Secondly, there is so much herd behaviour here. Most people here are sheeps. They don't think for themselves, they just echo what's being said here, which is ""JUST HODL, BUY THE DIPS"". 

Lastly, to keep it short, most here hate losing. But that's a big fat mistake. When you buy crypto, you should know exactly when you're gonna sell; at what loss and at what profit. When you haven't thought about this, you're gonna make emotional decisions. A lot of people dollar cost average, don't do this. You should never put more money in a stock/crypto that is declining in value. You are essentially sponsoring a loser. ",32

- bittrex dont take new users
- bitstamp have been reviewing my documents for weeks now... no sign of them, so i still cant buy

i made an account on gatehub, transferred a little bit ($50 worth as a test) of ETH from my coinbase account, and then converted it to XRP on there, but I REALLY don't feel comfortable with that site. there's something off, I can't put my finger on it, but I could never trust it with $10k for example

I actually just want to remove my XRP from gatehub and just close my account that's how uncomfortable i am with it..

Do you have a recommendation for a secure website other than bittrex and bitstamp, that would allow me to buy XRP in a matter of days?

I have lost over 300 btc on two my Binance accounts. On 16th of May all balances have gone to zero. I have contacted Binance support. No useful help has followed. Each appeal to support takes no less then 36 hours to answer. Moreover, the answers are “contact your email provider in order to receive mails with withdrawal confirmations”, “we do not see any withdrawals in may, why balance is zero then..” and more sophisticated one - “could you provide evidence that you previously hold up over 300 btc”.. 

Interestingly, I had unauthorized logins from different town and different IP on 15th of May. No sms or email confirmations about that. Also The April and May histories are erased. Have written these to support. 

Each account is linked to different cellular and mail providers. I do not think that all of them were hacked at the same time. I use Gmail and Protonmail. Seems like Binance has been hacked and I lost over 300 btc from my accounts. And no coverage from Binance fond has been provided. However, CZ told the opposite. 

I have written to instagram and twitter of CZ and Binance. No answer has followed. 



I have all tickets and all screens of my appeals and support ones. All is saved on different clouds. 
 
PLEASE UPVOTE. I NEED THIS TO BE SEEN!!!

If someone from Binance sees it, please, help to resolve this situation!

UPDATE  1

To start I would like to prove that my balance should not be zero as binance shows it now (screen below).

Also please notice that there are no withdrawals in April and May. However I have done them. 

Screens are from ONE account. 

Maths:
In 130 btc (without last page, I will reload it later) 
Out 70 bts
Balance + 60 btc
But on the screen in the right top corner you can see ZERO

Why is this coin in the top 5 at all?,"Whenever I see anything being posted about BCash on Twitter I have the subjective feeling that 90% of the people there bashing BCash.

When in fact 10% are supportive. I know that BCash was airdropped to all Bitcoin hodler's and it's actually worth something. It all boils down to the SegWit2X debate and tx speed and costs.
While a lot of investors may keep a pretty neutral or indifferent attitude there are in fact the die hard BTC core supporters or just three  fractions or camps: one camp hating on BCash everytime there's anything mentioned to it and a small camp supporting this coin.
I don't think the third camp, the indifferent camp is making up the most of investors.

I personally don't like BCash either. Zero tx confirmation 8mb blocksize so what gives? This coin is worth less than LTC from a technical pov. though it's ranking higher.
What I'd like to understand is: who is investing in BCash when it's the most controversial coin in the top ten?!

Not to mention Roger Ver. Don't know whether the die hard BCash supporters would love to see him shut up forever since he's really annoying and pathetic. He's saving The live of third world babies cuz of his 8mb blocksize increase smh.

They are desperate for events they can point at to make them feel smart and have ‘proof’ they were right all along. Most of the days they feel terrible since these events are scarcer than Bitcoin itself. They have the peak of the bubble of 2017 and now the huge dip of 2020, the start of the big economic collapse.

Ignore the noise. They either have an altcoin they need to pump 500% to recover their losses or they need that itchy feeling to go away telling them Bitcoin might come back stronger than ever to prove them wrong.

Bitcoin is still on track to be the best performing bearer asset the world has ever seen. It has a predictable monetary policy with a provable scarcity. Right now 1800 BTC is created daily through the block rewards. In 4 years time, after the next two halvings, this has become 450 BTC daily. By then it has a higher stock to flow than gold and it is the world most scarce bearer asset. And on top of that it is easily divisible and transferred digitally.

Yes, Bitcoin took a massive dump (altcoins even worse!) but even gold went down over 4%. You would think that the only real SoV would skyrocket in times like these, but the alt-and nocoiners of Reddit have decided that -4% is not a problem for a SoV, but Bitcoin needs to only rise in value every day. 

This is nonsense. Ofcourse crypto took a much bigger dump, but that is because it is still a very risk asset and those tend to be sold off first in times of crisis.

Let’s look at the yearly lows of Bifcoin:


2012: $4 

2013: $65 

2014: $200 

2015: $185 

2016: $365 

2017: $780 

2018: $3,200

2019: $3,360

2020: around $3,900 so far.

Bitcoin is only 11 years old. Gold has been used for thousands of years, is widely accepted as a SoV and even gold lost 4% in value. Just wait how central banks will need to print trillions of dollars and how everyones fiat will be debased significantly. Gold as it’s age as a positive property, but Bitcoins potential is much bigger.

Bitcoin only needs to keep grinding block after block. You only need to stay calm and ignore the noise.",100

I mean that quite literally.  The coin is basically a more shitty penny stock and I will explain why.  This needs to be heard and repeated because this coin is starting to be shilled hard and people are going to lose a lot of money.

When you invest in Ethereum, or Bitcoin, or Iota, or Neo, you are betting on the eventual widespread adoption of these technologies.
The basis of the bet is that widespread adoption of the blockchain will drive demand for the currency/token, leading to price appreciation.

The problem with MODUM, and other scam icos, is that they have issued a token, but the demand for the token is not connected with  the adoption of the blockchain that the token is a part of.  Companies can use MODUM's blockchain technology without purchasing any of MODUM's tokens.  The tokens only exist as a mechanism for profit sharing and corporate governance.

The token is literally just stock in their company.  It pays dividends like a stock and it gives shareholder voting power like a stock.  The token does literally nothing else.

So in effect, this company just did a public stock offering with ABSOLUTELY ZERO regulation.  People advise against buying penny stocks because the markets are unregulated.  But even OTC markets have some regulations.

There has been a fierce debate this year about whether cryptos should be considered currency or securities.  Well, this crypto is most definitely a security.  It does not have any currency like traits.  If you think you will receive a cent of profit sharing from this company, you are very optimistic and, in my opinion, naive.  Investing in modum's token is an act of pure faith as they have ZERO legal obligation to share any profits with you.  ",74

It may have saved my life, and I'll always be thankful. Crypto is so much more than just an investment vehicle!","In late 2016 the military announced that trans people could come out and serve.  So I did.  I had been thinking on it for years, accepting it about myself for years, and I remember that fateful morning walking into the counselor's office.  
 
After and endless barrage of mandatory questions about unrelated nonsense, she finally got to the point - ""*What's wrong?  Why are you here?*"" 
 
""I think.... No.. Not I think.""  I steeled myself, held the tears back, and took a deep breath.  ""I know I am transgender."" 
 
""Oh sweetie,"" she replied, her eyes getting big.  ""Is that the first time you've ever said that out loud to someone?"" 
 
I burst into tears for the next half hour.  It was finally done.  I had come out.  I felt simultaneously sick and in the greatest relief of my life. 
 
I went back several times over the coming weeks to speak with them, and after a month I was sure I wanted to start hrt immediately.  I had been waiting long enough, reading about it long enough, and I wrote in a private journal (back in Xmas 2015) that ""*there will be no 2017 for me without transition, I absolutely will begin by then*"". 
 
That's when the military informed me the process of gender transition was so new, they didn't even have procedures in place to assign hormone replacement therapy (hrt) yet.  In case you aren't aware, that's the process of stopping someone's (incorrect) birth sex hormones (in my case testosterone) and supplying the correct hormones (in my case estrogen and progesterone).  It creates a second puberty in the individual which brings both the brain and body into a state where the person's gender identity matches what they are experiencing biologically.  
  
""That's not going to be okay,"" I explained to them.  ""I have a diagnosis that gender transition is medically necessary, and you're telling me you don't know when I can actually have these *medically necessary* hormones?  And you have no idea at all what the timeline will be to get them?""  Let me assure you, it is a special hell to come out and finally accept that part of yourself... Only to be told you have to continue to suffer in the wrong sex hormones because a bloated bureaucracy can't get their act together.  
 
My work performance declined, I became despondent, and I explained day after day  to my gatekeepers that I needed to start hrt immediately.  Their reaction was either confusion or to treat me as if I was spoiled for expecting that I would be able to get a prescription in any sane amount of time. 
 
By the dawn of December I decided ""**f&#$ them**"".  I had already spent months learning everything there was to know about trans endocrinology.  I was the one explaining to the doctors on base how the process of hormone replacement worked.  I knew far more than they likely ever would, including the precise doses I needed to slowly turn off my male hormones and replace them with female ones in a safe fashion.  2017 was coming, and there was no 2017 for me without transition.  
 
So with the help of the Reddit trans community I found an online pharmacy and a site that let's you order your own labs and blood work.  This online pharmacy was based out of Europe and had everything I needed... only problem was that the act of ordering your own medication had been deemed undesirable by the powers that be.  **The site that had the very thing I needed to go on living had been blocked by every major payment method... PayPal, Visa, banks, etc, etc.  All except one.  They took Bitcoin.** 
 
A few days into December my hands were shaking as I transferred the btc to them via BitPay and the order confirmed.  A week or so later they arrived: my first dose. 
 
12/12/2016 was day one of HRT for me.  I've been transitioning ever since.  The military was of course furious when they found out, but I was ferocious in my defense of what I had done.  I successfully argued that if the military refused to provide me with what I needed for the condition they themselves had diagnosed me with, then I had the right to take my health into my own hands.  Oh, and it was about 6 months later when they finally got their act together enough to refer me to an endocrinologist... who simply validated what I was already doing on my own.  I wouldn't have been able to sanely wait those 6 unnecessary months for hormones.  
 
I'm happier than I've ever been here in May of 2018.  Before my future seemed like a grey cloud of nothing, and now it's full of life, friendship, and possibilities.  I have the body I always expected and my brain runs on the right hormones instead of being poisoned daily by unwanted testosterone.  And I don't stress about the periods of time when I have to switch providers, or when I need to get a prescription unknotted between cities... Because I know bitcoin and the internet will always allow me to get the hormones I need to sustain myself. 
 
Gender dysphoria put me in a horrific secret prison my entire life, and it was Bitcoin that finally allowed me to escape it.  I'll never forget that, and I'll always be thankful. 
 
I know people are visual and curious.  If you're wondering what I look like, I'm not an ultra feminine person, and usually dress rather butch in my day-to-day life.  Here's me, cheers: https://i.imgur.com/WzjSGEC.jpg",133

How about you start **adding value** to projects you love and helping with **adoption**? Because, trust me, there is almost **NONE**. Show me one Dapp that is user friendly for normies to use, I dare you. We should have dapps that don’t require the user to make transactions for every little engagement they have with the website. The fact that this is happening at scale means that are too few marketers in this space that understand human behavior. **Yes, marketers, WE NEED YOU TOO**. So start speaking up.

Ethereum, the only one that I had hopes for, is still **struggling with scalability** and Vitalik doesn’t seem to have an answer which is very worrying. All the other legit blockchain platforms like Lisk, Ark, Icon and thousands of others are falling behind with **zero marketing or partnerships**. Why are they not offering incentives for developers and entrepreneurs to build projects on? If they would just offer grants of their native token, the dapps on the platforms would rise. You’re creating money out of thin air FFS, why not give it out to boost adoption?

Seriously, get your heads out of your asses if you care about decentralized future. The only news everyone cheers about are memes, Bakkt (wtf?) or some banks talking about how digital currencies are the future. Banks are not the ones that should be in charge of adoption, revolutionary minds like you are. **Start developing apps/business plans, gather like minded people and build communities**. Stop copying existing social media platforms and come up with new ideas by identifying CURRENT problems. If you ask me, the future of blockchain and DLT is far from prosperous, and if you care, start doing something about it instead of checking the price every hour.

Since then I've been working tirelessly to release this to the public.

The app has paid out over 30k TRX in it's month long beta.

This is an investment free app that will earn you TRX.

How it works: It is fully ad supported, users simply have to log in, play some free games and collect their TRX. The pool is loaded with the ad revenue and users collect shares from checking in, watching video ads, and playing games. These shares give you a share of the ad revenue paid once monthly. The pool grows as more users play games as losses feed the pool and the lottery system. The games offer trx prizes for instant TRX.

**Updates since beta:**

New chance based game where you bet TRX for a chance to possibly double it.

Smaller ads for better UI on certain screens.

Lotto system, every 7 daily logins rewards you with 1 lotto ticket, there will be 3 winners per month who split the pot which starts at 5000 trx. Losing the games will fund the lotto pot so it will grow all month until the draw. The jackpot on the number game rewards 1 lotto ticket now as well.

Pool is now fed by both ad rev, and people playing games as losses are added to the pool. The pool will be huge by end of each month.

**Things that are coming:**

Referral system, PvP games where users stake TRX and the winner takes all.

Thanks, and have fun

Don't do this because it's a complete scam. There is no white paper, no one knows anything about the coin's purpose, use cases or who's behind it. Zero transparency and a dead project. Please refer to this thread whenever you see a post about ICON.**

When browsing /biz/ I read about a coin called ICONIC. Someone was shilling about low market cap, that it had the potential to explode in value.. the usual. I started doing my own investigation. My first stop was this thread on bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1677661.0 . I invite you to read through the entire thread, but here's a summary:  

* There was an ICO
* A token swap is promised
* The coin got dumped hardcore
* OP (who is the only one ever from the team to post) goes silent for weeks
* People talk about an attempt to 'resurrect' the coin, whatever that means
* The thread gets locked 'until relaunch' shortly after that by the OP. This was in July.

Around the time people are catching on that the whole thing was a scam, someone posts this screenshot from the official site: http://i.imgur.com/tJIKMfkr.png. Now, this raises three huge red flags. *First*, my Google skills are great, but nothing I threw at Google turned up anything on those names. Nothing developer related, nothing blockchain related, let alone anything Iconic related. *Second*, those people are no longer on the official site. In fact, the entire team section is removed: http://iconicproject.com/. But weirdest of all is that the whitepaper section from the screenshot is gone too. The only remnant of the whitepaper is this unreadable screenshot on twitter: https://twitter.com/ICONICTOKEN/status/798529283543154688. Notice how their Twitter account has been silent since december 2016.

So after reading this complete shitshow, and noticing that their last GIT update was 10 months ago, I was put off immediately. I decided to do one more search on /r/cryptocurrency on ICONIC and got two hits. One from someone who stumbled on the coin 9 days ago, but also another post that, at the time, was JUST created as I found the post on /biz/. You can find it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/71pm3a/icon_hidden_champion/

Now, judging from the points being made in this post, the structure and the tone of the writing, I could tell that this was the same person that was shilling the coin on /biz/, though I can't 100% prove this. This post was made by account /u/Phobos0815. This account has it's entire 3 year history removed... more alarming still is the fact that this account never posted anything Cryptocurrency related until yesterday.

When I confronted the OP of the thread in the comments, he kept playing the 'just put in a LITTLE bit of money to avoid risks' card. This is the same argument that he used in other threads that I found both here and on /biz/, leading to me to believe that this is in fact all the same person who is either running this scam or someone who wants to dump major bags.

Since that moment, the growth chart has surprised me a lot. But most people who now buy prl do not understand the basic principles of its pricing.

I will try to explain why I sold all my assets. I understand that a lot of prl investors will see this, but I advise you, read up to the end and try to understand what is written here before you make an assessment on this post.

I will not describe here theoretical problems, such as how much time and resources a browser will need to split a 1GB file into 1Kb pieces and whether it is easier than a conventional cloud storage. Or how long it will take to generate 1mil of transactions for just a 1GB of data in tangle, which now still has many problems. Let's talk only about one side - about pricing:

The quotation of the main developer:
""the PRL price will become very stable, gradually increasing at whatever rate the peg is increasing.
if the price is lower than the storage peg evaluation, then the market is irrational
if the price is higher than the storage peg evaluation, then the market is irrational and people will sell it.""

From this it follows that any price that prl will now reach before opening a test\main network - does not make any sense. After the discovery of the network and accordingly after hardcoding into smartcontract the specific equality 'prl = amount of data', the price will be changed and will correspond to the price of storing a certain amount of information per year. And this equasion is simply chosen by the chief developer. That is, the prl price in the future entirely depends on how much the creator wants for 1 token. Are you satisfied with this approach to your investments?",28

I fear these people are going to get burned and will be left with a very bad taste in their mouth about Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin

Ripple is just out of control at the moment and the new Investors in Crypto are going CRAZY for it. These people love it for its (low) unit cost. They think Ripple is cheap and Bitcoin is expensive but fail to understand that the total supply of Ripple is 100 BILLION coins. While the coin sounds cheap it absolutely is NOT. I think it is very important to inform ALL people that are getting into Ripple that the Market cap of Ripple (when calculated with the total supply of coins) is currently over 260 BILLION US dollars. This is for a CENTRALISED coin that more represents stock in a company rather than a Decentralised crypto currency. 
Since its more like stock in a company, I think its fair that we compare it's market cap to that of other companies. 

260 BILLION dollars is just a quarter of the market cap of Apple... The BIGGEST company in the world. Do we REALLY think that Ripple (which doesn't currently have ANYONE using their service) is worth a quarter of Apple? Google? Amazon? This is just getting out of hand.

I have spoken to many people investing in XRP and the consensus seems to be: ""Bitcoin was at $2 and then went to almost $20,000, I think the same thing will happen with Ripple"" For ripple to go to $20,000; The market cap would be in the TRILLIONS! Ripple... Trillions? What?!?!

Please people, Lots of us have been in Crypto for MANY years and its our responsibility to educate people on the importance of decentralisation and why we are all here in the first place. I don't think any one of us want to see our friends get burned putting money into something just because it's listed on Coinmarketcap. ",126

First of all, sorry for posting it a bit late I have some serious changes in my lifestyle and business due to Coronavirus situation in the world. For those who are infected I wish to get well soon and all the rest to stay safe and to stay home.

Here is my short story:On March 12th I made similar but short post regarding my stolen IOTA in the sub r/IOTA. First of all I met around 50% downvotes, I don’t know why but it seems that IOTA’s community don’t want to see posts regarding stolen IOTA, I got a lot of critics for using Trinity wallet instead of hardware and so on. But I see nothing strange using desktop wallet and it doesn’t matter whether it is IOTA Trinity or Bitcoin QT or Ethereum wallet unless in has strong manually typed password, VPN connection and some other security things. Or maybe IOTA’s community was afraid of unwanted bad attention during that market crash that day. So because of that experience I decided to make a post here at r/CC.

Some short reminder of what happened before my funds got stolen ([https://status.iota.org](https://status.iota.org/))

Some news:[https://www.coindesk.com/iota-foundation-suspends-network-probes-fund-theft-in-trinity-wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/iota-foundation-suspends-network-probes-fund-theft-in-trinity-wallet)[https://cointelegraph.com/news/iota-foundation-investigates-funds-allegedly-stolen-from-trinity-wallets](https://cointelegraph.com/news/iota-foundation-investigates-funds-allegedly-stolen-from-trinity-wallets)[https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/55955/iota-foundation-funds-stolen-users-of-trinity-wallet](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/55955/iota-foundation-funds-stolen-users-of-trinity-wallet)

If you don’t want to read that news here are some facts with timestamp:

**February 12th 2020 - 18:55**

As a precaution we ask you to keep your Trinity wallet closed for now.

**February 12th 2020 - 19:20**

After initial investigation we decided to turn off the Coordinator to make sure no further theft can occur until we find out the root cause of these thefts. (Lets say: “blockchain stopped”)

**February 14th 2020 - 17:50**

We have found the exploit.

**February 15th 2020 - 00:50**

After successfully identifying the attack on Trinity through a third-party integration

**February 17th 2020 - 02:23**

We have just released a safe version of Trinity Desktop to allow users to check their balance and transactions. ***This version (1.4.1) removes the vulnerability announced on 12th February 2020.*** (I’ve installed this particular version)

**February 21st 2020 - 18:43**

ACTION MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROTECT YOUR TOKENS IN TRINITY.

***February 24th I left my country for some working trip***

**February 26th 2020 - 13:10**

We are currently in the testing phase of the migration tools, once testing completes the tools will be audited by a external party. If this all goes well we are aiming to release these tools later this week.

**February 29th 2020 - 19:15**

The Seed Migration Tool is now available.

**March 6th 2020 - 15:17**

REMINDER: You have until 5PM (UTC), Saturday, 7th March to migrate your seed.

***I’m still out of the country but I’m pretty sure I’m safe coz I’ve installed 1.4.1 wallet which removes the vulnerability.***

**March 8th 2020 - 18:15**

The migration period has ended.

***I got back to my country***

**March 10th 2020 - 16:45**

We are aiming to resume value transactions around 5PM CET today.

**March 10th 2020 - 18:15**

The network coordinator has resumed operation. (Let’s say “blockchain restarted”)

Same day I’ve made first post on reddit to get some attention to the happened situation. At the same time I’ve start to search for some technical support through over official telegram groups:

*iotatangle*

([https://imgur.com/McmrF3L](https://imgur.com/McmrF3L))I’ve send a message where I’ve stated that my funds were stolen after network relaunch. Got some response from user *Basti* he invited me to another group with general discussion.screen shot 1 ([https://imgur.com/hvDuoQA](https://imgur.com/hvDuoQA))screen shot 2 ([https://imgur.com/MewdNm5](https://imgur.com/MewdNm5))

Our short dialogue continued at the general discussion group *iotacafe*

([https://imgur.com/e9ErcPW](https://imgur.com/e9ErcPW)) Where *Basti* introduced me to the IOTA Foundation member Antonio Nardella ([https://imgur.com/WxZRk8N](https://imgur.com/WxZRk8N))

Before I started my conversation with Antonio I decide to get some information about him. I’ve found a Medium post with some welcoming words to Antonio Nardella.

([https://imgur.com/KK4zoOv](https://imgur.com/KK4zoOv)) telegram([https://imgur.com/VquNCpi](https://imgur.com/VquNCpi)) medium

Seems legit.

Of course I couldn't be 100% sure it was him but the information he asked for wasn’t really sensitive so decided to share all I knew and all I did.

([https://imgur.com/X3Ha02Q](https://imgur.com/X3Ha02Q)) He also mentioned a wallet integrated service *MoonPay*, whether I used the wallet with this service or not and it didn’t matter if I used the service it self.

I’ve informed him that I used 1.4.1 wallet which was recommended to install on **February 17th 2020**([https://imgur.com/iZdNcm7](https://imgur.com/iZdNcm7))

When he gathered all the necessary information regarding loss of funds he took the time for sending this information for investigation team.

After a long awaited answer I got the same day this:

“Hello, I was informed that ***the loss of tokens is associated to the person/team responsible for the Trinity wallet attack via a third-party dependency from Moonpay.***

As suggested on [https://status.iota.org/](https://status.iota.org/), please file a report with the local police and to cite the following case number when doing so: LKA Berlin, Center for Cybercrime, case number: 200213-1717-i00290.”([https://imgur.com/Gov1v0i](https://imgur.com/Gov1v0i))  


So, reinstalling the wallet didn't help me to avoid the loss of funds.

Well if my funds are proved to be stolen then it means - yes, I’ve used the Trinity wallet between the December 17th 2019 and the February 17th 2020. And yes, I wasn’t able to make seed transition during the given period. I was out of the country starting form Feb 24th till March 8th. I can even proove it with my border passing stamps… You know I didn’t use to take 4.5Ti with me just in case I would need an urgent seed transition. Could you imagine thousands of people with their multimillion Bitcoin holdings carrying private keys everyday with them just in case they would need seed transition… The funds were stolen not by my mistake but IOTA developers/foundation/etc (lets say IOTA team) mistake.

At the end of my story I want to take your attention to the fact that I didn’t compromise my PC neither wallet nor password nor seed. All my fault was for using the desktop wallet… How can you imagine your user without using your software/services/etc… I want to publicly call IOTA team (especially mr David Sonstebo) to cover not only those which were to happen back in the Feb 2020 but all the loses which were caused by that wallet vulnerability.

If I help even one person with this then it's worth it.

I set up a coinbase account today to buy only a few dollars worth of Litecoin.

After they verified my account or so they claim to, they let me purchase the coins and then when I try to use them they told me I needed to verify with a photo ID.

I currently have my green card as my primary ID because my driver's license is expired.

Turns out you can't verify with anything other than a driver's license if you're in the United States or a valid state ID.

My problem isn't with verification, it's with the method they're using.

Having people be able to purchase their currency and then telling him later in order to use it they need to do these extra steps is a very poor business practice.

Especially when during your account setup you provide them practically everything and they tell you that your account has been verified so you think everything's fine.

This seems like a kind of bait and switch period

The obvious is that I could have paid a lot more and not verified my ID with other services, but I rarely if ever use crypto and I just needed it one time for the lowest possible fee period

So there you go, buyer beware with coinbase I suppose",32

&#x200B;

OPEN LETTER TO VECHAIN COMMUNITY

***I would like to stress that this open letter is not designed as an attack on VeChain and it is not my intention to damage VeChain or the value of its tokens. It is not my purpose to prevent people from investing in VeChain. It is for each individual to decide that for themselves. The goal here is to do my bit and help clean the community of bad actors so the project can move forward and prosper.***

&#x200B;

Dear VeChain community,

I have written the following piece in the hope it inspires our community to take a closer look at VeChain’s associates as I fear there are unscrupulous players who are exercising significant influence over the project. I was brought up to never take things for granted and never be ashamed of asking questions. This has led to me having the mind that I would not take things at face value, always question and give consideration to other possibilities. It has served me well especially since I started in crypto a couple of years ago.

## RISK

In the wild west of crypto it is important to do everything we can to ensure we minimize the risks we are taking with our investments. When we compare crypto investing to mainstream investment opportunities, crypto can be classified as extreme high risk. With that risk comes the potential for extreme high reward. This, along with the ease and speed at which we are able to set up crypto investments is the main attraction for the majority of us. So when we find a company which we believe has an amazing vision and a top notch team such as VeChain, we are often desperately keen to commit large percentages of our portfolios to them. The greater the risk the greater the reward, right?

## CAVEAT EMPTOR

The largely unregulated crypto space has a community which does a great job at protecting its own. There are many people out there dedicating a lot of their valuable time warning of fraudulent ICO’s, con men and scammers, but also helping people navigate the pitfalls of the technology itself.

“Caveat Emptor” (Buyer Beware), “Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose”, “Keep a diversified portfolio” are all mantras which we see across social media and form the basis for ensuring that we minimise risk yet maintain the potential for high reward.

“DYOR” (Do your own research) is one of the most important of these and yet perhaps the most ignored. If you have ever invested in an ICO without having read the white paper then you fall into this category. Often we do not find the time, have the inclination or have the technical ability to read and understand white papers, “Someone more clever than me will read it and they’ll tell us if it’s good or not”. Also, YouTube has no shortage of crypto influencers ranging from the high quality honest commentators to the Robin Hoods, to the downright corrupt who will take payment in return for their shilling services. Which YouTuber we chose to believe is often the one who speaks favorably about our own investment and not necessarily the one we believe to be the most honest.

## SLIPPERY SLOPE

The trouble with allowing others to research on our behalf is that we have no way of separating truth from lies or fact from fiction. If we give up ownership of understanding and knowledge then we find ourselves in dangerous waters. By becoming passive in this way we are at great risk of being exploited. This is pervasive in crypto and we see entire communities rise and fall in this way.

Satoshi created blockchain technology to overcome issues of trust and yet many of us who embrace the technology are quite happy to place our blind faith in projects based on what we hear from others.

It is time to remove the blindfolds.

## HIDING IN THE SHADOWS

I will now discuss someone who has only recently come out of the shadows but who has been working with VeChain since November 2017. Someone who is listed as a strategic advisor and is involved with many different projects on the VeChain platform. It is up to yourselves to look into this person as I am in no doubt that his involvement with VeChain and its ICO’s is potentially seriously damaging to these projects. It is concerning to know that he has such close ties with CEO, Sunny Lu. It is my opinion that he may have committed securities fraud and financial crime and as a US citizen could eventually be prosecuted.

The information in the profile written below is public knowledge and therefore I do not feel obliged to provide evidence.

## JACKSON FU

* Chinese American citizen
* One of two people who make up the company known as CREAM, LLC (A Limited Liability Company (LLC) means your personal assets are protected from legal claims made against the company. The LLC separates the members from the business itself.)
* Does not have a business address as CREAM, LLC do not have any offices and there are no phone numbers registered with the Nevada Secretary of State, only a P.O. Box address
* Link to NVSOS (CREAM, LLC): [https://www.nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?lx8nvq=iXiqcIlj2lTHkdi5%252fj1hEg%253d%253d&nt7=0](https://www.nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?lx8nvq=iXiqcIlj2lTHkdi5%252fj1hEg%253d%253d&nt7=0)
* Prior to its involvement with VeChain in November 2017, CREAM, LLC has zero track record
* The company website is blank, has no content and all the social media links simply return you to the website’s single page with the exception of the twitter link which is for a banned account.
* Link to company website: [http://creamandpartners.com](http://creamandpartners.com/)
* Is an official advisor to VeChain and the following VeChain ICO’s: OceanEx, CAHrenheit, PLAIR, Safe Haven, MustangChain, Esprezzo, DECENT.BET
* Has insider knowledge of VeChain
* Has made public predictions of VeChain token price
* Is widely believed to be behind the Twitter shill account, The Coca Cola Kid (CCK)
* Is the main Admin in the Telegram group chinacrypto.info abbreviated as CCI. He is called CREAM in this group
* Recruited from CCI to form a closed group and insisted on them giving him KYC information promising to make them millionaires
* Made indirect threats of violence in CCI to anyone who betrays him when asked why he required KYC details
* Encourages and helps his admins and members participate in FUD campaigns. I have witnessed attacks on: Neo, Ontology, Waltonchain and CPChain amongst others

## CLOSING THOUGHTS AND SPECULATION

Until recently I was satisfied with the risk reward ratio I had in VeChain however when suddenly this character CREAM came out of nowhere naturally I was curious. So I watched the Amsterdam meetup video to reaffirm my belief in the project and when I heard Jackson Fu’s speech I started to have a gut reaction about him and his CREAM “company’” that all was not right. The fact that he is involved in every VeChain ICO is alarming to me. He has been praised for coming from a financial background however has no technical expertise. Add to that the rumours surrounding him and the extensive hype marketing and I found myself doing extensive research that I wanted to share with you.

All these red flags draw me to the inevitable conclusion that Jackson Fu is making himself and his close knit group rich by manipulating investors and the price of the VeChain token. I will now share with you what I believe to be the template Jackson Fu uses. Please note that this is my theory based on the research I did which included lurking in CCI for longer than I would have wished and monitoring other community’s social media.

* Choose your next low cap project and buy large amounts of cheap tokens
* Create a private group of likeminded lieutenants and insist on them giving up KYC details to protect yourself from future betrayals
* Form a relationship with the target company’s CEO by offering your marketing and hype services. In return take payment in the form of tokens, control of the company social media accounts and official roles in the ICO’s
* Get to work and hype the company and start to build the token price (recruit crypto YouTubers)
* Sell off some tokens on the pumps
* Create a social network channel which runs parallel but not in conjunction with official channels and drip feed insider knowledge to make the members feel privileged and secure their loyalty. This is the pool to recruit from for future ventures
* Promote the BUY & HODL mentality while making outlandish short term future price predictions
* Sell off some tokens on the pumps
* Find a competing project and use your lieutenants to start a crypto “war” in order to create a common enemy that your social group can unite over
* Sell off some tokens on the pumps
* Have your lieutenants orchestrate the spread of this “war” to the larger community and attack other communities in order to keep the FUD and common enemy story alive
* If the token dumps use the “war” as a distraction and utilize proven pump techniques such as The Coca Cola Kid (CCK) tweets
* Make big money and move on to the next project leaving the small fish holding nothing but their broken dreams
* Rinse and repeat

This is clearly damning stuff and I suggest anyone who is invested in VeChain or its ICO’s look into this for themselves. At the very least his behaviour in public social media groups is certainly not what you would expect from an official advisor to companies with global aspirations.

Thanks for reading,

Anon

(Having seen how Steven Mostoviy was treated after publishing a YouTube video of his visit to the VeChain offices and addressing some of our concerns I have decided to remain anonymous)

I think too many people are really not benefiting from cryptocurrency, and it'd be nice if they stuck around instead of losing money to shit like bitconnect in desperation of $$$","I think there's a lot of solid advice out there for newer people... but I've observed so many friends not doing really simple stuff and getting frustrated... I've gone through the ropes of turning $250 into $10k during half of December before it all crashed for depressing Jan, but now things are starting to get *really* juicy; but I've yet to see ANYONE even mention some obvious things people are missing.



like moon mission coins. I love a x10, but a x1.5 every day for a week is better.



I was going to write one for my friends to spend an hour to read so they can either go and improve; or use some tried and tested tactics I've been taught from my financial advisor who's addicted to crypto...


I think I have some unique insights into things that're upcoming that aren't really known to non-techies too. I don't think most people on my level know what technical analysis is or how I avoided not having ripped my hair out this jan from BTC making alts tank every other day (hint: I saw it coming early and prepared. I think ""holding"" is great for when you have enough money to make it worth holding, haha)



after bitconnect happened I felt nothing but sadness. I kind of have been predicting this year that crypto is going to be full of criminals looking for a quick buck before LE starts to crack down on fraud, and it's actually going to wreck a really cool thing going on which is a fair chance for people to get in on what's very likely going to be a millionaires game sooner than most think.



I think 2019 will still be a good year for us who think we got in late... but the fact is, is that there's only so many coins that're going to survive into 2019. do we really need 50 meme coins and do people really think they have value? dodgecoin became a legitimate product because it got in early and people found a way to make money, that's all.


I don't think we're in a bubble like I see is commonplace FUD... but I do think that there's going to be a lot of companies working on the same product merging and/or being bought out. I know silicon valley is starting to be really bullish the past few months on blockchain tech since it's showing to be really useful.




oh... and stop hoarding bitcoin if you are adamant you don't want to do anything but wait... ETH is going nowhere, it's predicted to also flip bitcoin this year by many analysts out there. it has a LOT more room to grow due to it being a really useful tech. 



I'd also think about if you want to take a risk with a % of your money you wish to leave in something that's better than your bank account and minimally as safe as bitcoin...


NEO has been painted as the asian version of ETH, and had an insane year. it's starting to be used by a western tech company for one of their inhouse projects and is going nowhere.



I think NEO has more % gain (remember that big numbers are great but it's about % gains on your money. if you can somehow predict that a coin will go from 1sat to 100sat, it's better than a coin that'll go from $100 to $1000... people are blinded by things such as 100k bitcoin price... that's a rough 9x on money that's in right now and it's kinda farfetched to imagine bitcoin going to $100k before ETH goes to $10k....)



I'll prolly write the doc anyway, but I'll see if I can make it all neat and tidy if I have to post it on reddit (and not make jokes about my bosses. yikes!)


I think it's something that may benefit a lot of people with friends who hound them on what to pick and shit too. it's the easiest thing to find something to invest in short term.



a lot of the old guard like to spread stuff that just isn't worth it, and that annoys me too. crypto's not stocks nor is it gambling if you're confident in your picks.





I have so many friends who bought ADA and sat on it because of people saying it's good. it doesn't have a product and has been sitting at a bear price since they bought it, whereas other things with products have at least gained... heck.",71

Red Flags: They rolled their own crypto and MIT DCI cracked it in a week. Top dev/researchers don't think tangle/IOTA will work. They aren't decentralized and will not function without the coordinator. They make misleading statements about partnering with big companies. 

PREFACE: This cryptocurrency market is growing rapidly. Due to its nature of being highly volatile and free of regulations, many ill-informed people are putting money into projects after minimal research. I know I will get accused of spreading FUD, but it seems everyone thinks IOTA is this perfect quantum resistant cryptocurrency without fees that scales exponentially as the network grows. I want to share why this most likely is not the case. Mainly because I think it is bad for the crypto market to have $14B in a project that most experts think will fail.

I went to Ethan Heilman's talk about how the MIT DCI found collisions in their ternary hash function and was shocked by ""simple"" (for an encryption expert) the process was. For the hash function newbs, creating a hash function is incredibly difficult and takes years of the top experts trying to crack it before it is adopted ([History](http://valerieaurora.org/hash.html)); the number one rule ""Don't Roll Your Own Crypto"". DCI has also found a number of other vulnerabilities, to which IOTA responded by saying they knew about them and put them in there on purpose [[very fishy, scroll to response 4](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/iota-response/)]. 

They are completely centralized! Everything has to go through the coordinator. Most cryptocurrencies have big enough networks where they are virtually unstoppable. With IOTA, the coordinator can choose to [shut the network off for 3 days if they wanted to, which actually happened.](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/iota-response/) Let alone the fact that they have the ability to move funds out of people's accounts.

The top developers/researchers (Vitalik Buterin, Vlad Zamfir, Nick Johnson, Tadge from MIT DCI, Pantera Capital, and several others) in the space have come out against it. The technology sounds great on the surface, but at scale, it becomes very difficult to settle disagreements between edge nodes, especially considering the transaction set is theoretically unbounded, which means it could only survive in a centralized form with server farms having a ton of power over the network.

They release statements about ""partnerships"" with Microsoft, Cisco, and Huawei. Then backpedal and reiterate after the price goes up significantly: [Microsoft was only a “participant” in the data marketplace’s innovation exercise](https://blog.iota.org/iotas-data-marketplace-setting-the-record-straight-576fbf0b4513). Companies like Microsoft partner with thousands of organizations; this does not mean they are working closely together, so it is very misleading nonetheless.

Now many of those investments are down 90+% and the market itself is looking bleak.

The idea of HODLing was a meme to begin with which exploited so many obvious biases plaguing rookie investors. Anchoring bias, bandwagon bias, disposition bias, etc. You entered an unregulated space with (almost) zero investing experience and got played hard by people who knew what they were doing. This is not a hobby. This is a full-time career for many seasoned investors and traders and they’re all out to take your money.

There is zero nobility in holding an investment which has depreciated by over 90%. You are not cool, you do not have “strong hands”, you likely are not buying any dips (considering most of you have been ‘buying the dip’ for months), and you’d be laughed at for holding anything this long in any other market. 

My only hope is that this shitty series of events that has gone on over the last 8 months has made some of you understand the importance of cutting losses before they run away from you. You do not have to be a trader to set a stop loss, mental or in an order book. Many of the projects that were valued to highly only 8 months ago will never recover. People are going to end up with the realization that they have lost massive amounts of capital. Use this moving forward to make smarter investing decisions on BOTH sides of the trade - entry and exit.

I do think this is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed before it catches wind. Clarifying and dealing with this now rather than staying silent about it would be better for the company in the long-term.

**In short:**

1. WTC's company was halted during the month of September. This information was never shared until recently.
2. During this period, a WTC employee privately communicated to an investor to sell their tokens now now and buy back later.
3. After information about the WTC employee's suggestion became public and caused FUD, the employee made a statement saying she didn't know what she was saying due to a language barrier.
4. After foregoing events, 2 months later, WTC announces that their company was halted during this period.

This may imply 2 things:

1. WTC may have manipulated the token price by withholding information about their company being put to halt for the duration of a month.
2. An employee suggested specific trading actions to a trader in private, plausibly based on private company information (see 1).

This severely implies WTC has manipulated the market (withholding information), and an employee has committed insider trading (suggesting trading actions based on information which wasn't shared by the company). 

**Explained:**

[With the recent letter from Waltonchain](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ak9it/a_letter_from_waltonchain_foundation/?st=j9le8tbg&sh=3b08771e), addressing their recent developments etc., they also stated the following information which was largely unbeknownst to the public:

>**Chinese Central Government Ban on ICOs:**
>
On September 4th, 2017, the Chinese authorities issued a joint document to stop all ICOs and exchanges in China. At that very moment, the development of Waltonchain was put on hold under the direction of the Foundation. It was our goal to cooperate with the regulations and compliance of the government entirely. The foundation reinstated us to reopen business on the Sept. 26th.

***This information should have been public during the time it happened, not 2 months later. It could appear as damage control to control the token's price.***

I find their foregone vagueness in this matter and the fact that they tell us 2 months later to be very concerning and may be viewed by third parties (i.e. the government) as market manipulation.

During the month of September, where (as stated by WTC) their company was apparently completely halted by the Chinese government (while unbeknownst to the public), the Slack user **abbyyy**, who is WTC's secretary, stated the following to a user in private:

https://i.imgur.com/o3jl3oo.png

Quote 1:

>**abbyyy:** as your friend but not a WTC staff ,i think if delist would affect you very much, so sell your WTC ,but remenber to keep attention to us, i believe WTC will be back

Quote 2:

https://i.imgur.com/j2Hn9EL.png

*In this quote, abbyyy verifies there is a big possibility about a trading site delisting.*

Both quotes caused a lot of FUD in the Slack channel and it was being spread around communities.

**Abbyyy later stated that her communications were being misinterpreted due to an error in translation.**

However, the context of these statements now make a lot of sense regarding the timing of the apparent freezing of the company by the Chinese government. Regardless of intent, with this new information, this could be considered to be insider trading.

This means there is a possibility there was no translation issue in abbyyy's messages, and her statement's context would be most likely interpreted as: *""sell your WTC now""* (due to the company being frozen and not being able to develop the project whatsoever, with a possibility of being shut down), and *""buy back later, i believe we will be back""* (the company may be unhalted at a later date, at which point the investment would contain less risk).


Sharing this information with her friend in private, with the *knowledge* that the company was halted and under active investigation, while WTC had not clearly shared this information with the community, could be considered by the Chinese government as market manipulation followed by insider trading.

Does anyone else find this to be concerning? I think this needs to be addressed asap.",51

I have read all the info presented on the MIT case, I have read ALL the emails, every single one of them from both sides. So many people spreading fake things about this topic. This week news.bitcoin.com published an article about scams, phishing, hacks, etc. and they indicated that IOTA's wallet was hacked. Didn't they understand that it was a phishing website (not even SSL certificate) that people trusted and obtained compromised seeds from it?


Article: https://news.bitcoin.com/9-million-day-lost-cryptocurrency-scams/


Cointelegraph published an article with the title ""IOTA price analysis"" (voted by readers) and they spent the whole article spreading FUD about the emails and how unprofessional IOTA's team is, instead of focusing on price analysis. I have read every single email, and the only side that looked seriously unprofessional was the MIT team, not answering IOTA's team questions, not proving their statements, and trying to avoid the topic about Ethan being involved in a competitor project.


Article: https://cointelegraph.com/news/iota-weekly-price-analysis


All this only makes me think, that everyone is terrified about the potential of IOTA, and the geniuses behind this project. I only want to say something to the founders, the dev team, etc.: Guys don't let all this attacks affect you, don't waste time with the haters. The people like me that knows what is this project about and how it is being handle, we will support you no matter how much FUD haters spread. Keep up the excelent work you have been doing.

Ive seen some coins like ""REQ, LINK, VEN, ICX, XLM, ADA"" and readed something about the goals and ""technic"". Ive figured out those coins has been really cheap and bought some as i was like WOW -> REQ is going to replace Paypal and so on.

After ive been a few more time in crypto, spending all day and night into reading about each coin ive figured out something.

A coin like Request Network or Substratum is a Company wich sells their coin for a value it actually doesnt has. The Company has just an idea (dream) to replace Paypal or the VPN´s Internet (Substratum), but in the end it wont work anywhere near a few weeks/mounths/years.

Ive searched for REAL USE projects wich has actually a working product behind them or even a blockchain plattform.

I am asking myself now, why does people shill coins and dont invest in real tech like NEO? like SHIFT (instead of SUB)? 

Ive found today a coin named Zcoin and readed its one of the best privacy coins out there but never ever heard someone talking about, the only things i read here are 

WHY REQUEST NETWORK IS ...

WHY RAIBLOCKS IS ...

VECHAIN IS GOING HUGE ...

WHY TO BUY STELLAR, RIPPLE (CNBC Reporter mentioned before he bought Stellar aswell (wtf???))

i dont have anything against Raiblocks, it sounds super interesting but i have something against Vechain (too much supply to reach a big Price and the people are playing a pump and dumb anyways with it.

Why nobody mention Privacy coins? Can people  be more into CRYPTO instead into HYPE COIN SELL AT ATH - > Wow congrats, here for the quick money, but thats not the crypto case (its ok if u do some gains, why not, but thats not the goal here and this is aswell a point why the market is so unstable)

That led me to question what does cryptoholder wants? What is his goal?

Would i be wrong if i say that based on past, most people now does want quick money and get rich like some of people got when bc was 20k. (also that means that other side who bought at that time lost alot of money).

For example, if it goes back to 10k, that should probably mean that it will go down again (or up,  if you want) resulting again in highly RISKY investment and leading again to lesser adoption.

If that becomes trend, why would anyone want to hold some currency which can lose half of his value in short time. Isn't stability important?

Enlighten me please. What do you think? What is main goal for crypto?

**If they are so sure it scales why are they afraid of shitty projects clogging the network?** 

How can you claim something scales better than ETH when your solution is making the cost of deploying a single smart contract $25,000?

They said $25,000 is only for complex smart contracts and only $500 for simple contracts. Lol wtf counts as complex smart contracts? Is FuckToken in NEO considered complex. Also why do they need to charge complex smart contracts $25,000 if its soooooo scalable?

**EDIT: Lol creating a token is considered ""complex"" apparently.** Ffs, creating a token is the simplest use of a smart contract just look at the first smart contract programming tutorial for ETH. Humor me NEO bagholders, what app can I do that is considered ""simple"".
_____
**The real reason is probably to maintain the high price of NEO.**

 Last time Da Hongfei hinted at lowering the GAS needed the price of GAS tanked. NEO also tanked because its only incentive is producing GAS, lower gas price = lower price per NEO.
____
**OnChain's Greed**

The current circulating supply of NEO is 65,000,000. The total supply is 100,000,000. OnChain has half the total supply of NEO which they will use for ""development costs"". These uncirculated NEOs are not mined by NEO holders they are sold by OnChain. They already sold 15,000,000 NEO recently when NEO's price skyrocketed. The original supply is 50,000,000.

That means OnChain has way more tokens to profit from the rising NEO price compared to other smart contract platform teams. This is why they keep doing the ""announcements of announcements"" strategy.

**Name one smart contract platform where the team has the half the total supply for ""development costs"" other than NEO. Go on.**

____

**Anyone who thinks I'm fudding give a rationale for OnChain not lowering the insane gas costs.**

This issue has been going on for a long time now, XLM was able to lower the 20 XLM fee to maintain a wallet to 1 XLM easily. If they are not greedy then they are incompetent especially for a team that has 1/2 the total supply for ""development costs"".


_____

**EDIT: I just found out they have a new proposal (NEP-4 proposal):**

>In the NEP-4 proposal, you'll need to pay 1000 GAS ($50,000) to deploy a proxy contract that can dynamically invoke a second contract defined post-deployment by the owner. And you have to pay another 500 GAS ($25,000) for that contract deployment (and 500 more GAS each time you fix a bug, another $25,000).

LOL THEY DONT HAVE ANY PLANS ON LOWERING IT DESPITE THE CRITICISMS. Ffs, read the NEP-4 proposal to see how greedy OnChain and Citzens of Zion is.

**EDIT: Lmao this sub is delusional, all the excuses you gave dont justify the insane cost of creating a smart contract in NEO. NEO is the only blockchain that has these absurd fees which is probably because its the only smart contract platform FOUNDED BY A FOR PROFIT COMPANY**",50

Why? Basically because of quantum computers. 

Quantum computers can easily perform tasks that would take normal computers much longer, while doing plenty of other tasks at the same time! 

When I got thinking about it, cryptos were f’d. Why? Cryptographic algorithms that blockchains use to store and verify the correct history of transactions as well as secure the network are not resistant to quantum computers. At least in theory anyway - because we are still 10, maybe 15 years away from a fully functional quantum machine that would be capable of compromising the security of a cryptographically secured ledger such as Bitcoin say. 

But things in this sector are moving very quickly as a little light research will show: https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/digital-economy/todays-encryption-algorithms-threatened-quantum-leap

So while we maybe a bit away from this point the hype is real. Even the NSA are worried about quantum computers, saying that it will transition to quantum resistant algorithms in the near future: https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/913998/quantum-computers-encryption-data-nsa-gchq-microsoft

While doing a little digging into all things crypto and quants I found a little gem:  AToken Wallet. Its security features for its digital wallets are made by IVN quantum encryption technology. IVN has managed to develop a quantum resistant encryption and is so confident about its security features it has even offered up a $300 000 bounty to anyone that can crack their IVN encryption. So far no one has claimed the prize. If you’re up to the challenge or you’d like to find out more visit:  https://ivnsecurity.com/web/#home

Wraith is supposed to be a private encrypted ledger that you switch from and to depending on your privacy needs . At this late stage it looks like a TOR on/off button.

So many noobs on the sub buying XVG with credit on the PROMISE of ‘moon’, ‘lambo’ etc.

When this ‘release’ is released the noobs are going to hail it as a success with little to no understanding of what has actually been released. That’s not what we want going in to 2018. Shitcoins pumping 100x, let’s guide new investors to real tech that may well change the future.

There is a disturbing rise in new people looking for small market cap coins to turn a quick buck, the long term effect of this is not good for global market cap and the cause of a potential future bubble.

Guide new investors in to good projects and alert them to HIGH RISK upcommers.

Let’s not make 2018 the year of the shitcoin.

Happy new year and pease out.",39

First, it is extremely easy to do an ICO on Stellar. Just google it and all the information is given in plain, simple english. 

Second, Stellar has two extremely solid decentralized exchanges too - stellarport and stellarterm. Both let you login with just your stellar's private key so registration is optional on either DEX. And since Stellar transactions are as fast as Nano, you will love the experience. 

Both exchanges also support BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP and even BCH. Gvie them a try! I recently bought ETH using XLM on stellarport. You can also buy tokens like MOBI, USD token, RMT, ETX, OMG and BAT. 

Stellarport also has trollbox chat feature that I'm sure Poloniex users still remember. 

A lot of new tokens have been using Stellar platform for trading and ICO. 

The only thing missing from Stellar is smart contract and honestly, I have no idea if Stellar team has plans to implement functionality. ",33

A lot of Dogecoin believers really do think Dogecoin could one day be on parallel with Bitcoin. They have bought up huge amounts of the coin thinking that it will rise meteorically, just as Bitcoin did; that it will take over the globe and will award them with ludicrously massive returns. 

Here's the problem: Dogecoin is way too middle class America to conquer the globe. It belongs to the 24-30 year old New York media student set. It's entire image belongs alongside Gap adverts, and Apple iPod adverts, and other adverts where multicoloured balls randomly fall down the streets of San Francisco. It has personality. It is *cool*. It has irony, and is even ludicrous. It sent the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics. Haha, wow such comedy. Such doge.

The trouble with *doge* however is that it doesn't understand *why* Bitcoin is global. It's not looking at the situation through the eyes of the *global community* but rather the American-centric, liberal orientated world of the college middle classes.

Bitcoin has *zero* personality. It is *not* cool. It does not have a unified community that engages in unified campaigns. It is mute and humourless and numb. People of the world connect with it, because it can be anything you want it to be.

This is what it means to be global, and that's where it's beauty lies. It is universal.

Bitcoin is just as much pro-democracy as it is pro-China. It is just as much pro-Obama as it is pro-Putin. It is anti-American and pro-American, anti-European and pro-European. It can afford to be all of these things, and none of these things, because that is what it means to be universal: Neutral.

Dogecoin is not neutral. It has a refined community morality that is distinctly American of liberal undertones. (e.g Dogecoin could easily be pro-Hilary 2016.)

Much of Bitcoin's ascent revolves around its perception of being an alternative store of wealth during economic uncertainty. The attraction is its stateless and flagless architecture defined by deregulation. A blank canvas with no voice; just a technical means.

When the Cyprus bail-ins occurred and the banks started confiscating wealth, Cypriots trusted their life-savings with Bitcoin and were rewarded accordingly. The bitcoin price went higher and higher.

This simply would not have happened with Dogecoin. People just won't be willing to invest their life savings into a coin that started as a joke and has the personality derived from an alien culture. People want to look in the mirror and see their own reflections, not the reflections of strangers.

Today we see economic situations breaking down in the Ukraine, and Argentina, and even China. Bitcoin will inevitably benefit as situations destabilise.  Meanwhile Dogecoin is eagerly waiting for that day when its price will explode, just as in the case of Bitcoin. Will that day ever arrive? 

Only when the world turns into a global community of liberal Americans of the 24-30 year old age bracket. Sorry. It's *just not going to happen.*

The news about the possibility of releasing tokens on Bitcoin Cash blockchain failed the Ethereum price - the world's second crypto currency fell by 20% in 2 days. Trigger hook was a video clip of the Bitcoin Cash investor, Roger Ver, who announced the launch of the Wormhole protocol, which will allow to issue tokens and conduct ICO on the blockchain of ""true Bitcoin"". ""Perhaps we will soon have crypto- kittens,"" he said, adding that as the demonstration of the possibilities of the new protocol, ICO is of [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) is being planned.

The Wormhole protocol was developed in conjunction with the Chinese mining giant Bitmain, which publicly disowned Bitcoin in favor of Bitcoin Cash and withdrew all of its cryptocurrency into fork coins despite a financial loss of $ 500 million. Many experts in the crypto- industry believe that the Wormhole protocol will be very popular among developers , because the tokens on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain will be much easier to stock up on exchangers where the main coin of blockchain is already traded. The ERC20 standard on the Ethereum blockchain has recently experienced problems with listing due to the unrecoverable bug in the smart- contract. The developers of Ethereum are preparing the release of the new standard ERC777, but Roger Ver overtook them, offering the market an alternative, which affected the course Ethereum. There will be a chance to discuss with Roger Ver the possibility of placing ICO on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain on September 7-10 at [CoinsBank Blockchain Cruise](https://coinsbank.com/cruise-europe?r=1678181) in the Mediterranean and on September 10-13 at the [Futurama Blockchain innovators](https://futuramasummit.com/?r=1678181) summit in Spain on Ibiza",40

As we already know BMW hosted a ""competition"" where companies like Vechain and CartVertical participated in. The details of this competition are unknown but we do know it is to do with integrating blockchain technology into BMW. There is a good chance that information about the outcome will be released at the Beijing Auto show. That being an actual partnership announced by BMW.

It is the largest auto show in China and companies are likely to make announcements as there is heavy press/media presence. 
Source: http://gtspirit.com/category/carshows/auto-china/beijing-motor-show/

This may be a VERY GOOD opportunity to swing trade Vechain.

Currently, I have sources working on finding out whether or not Vechain developers or team members will be attending the car show. If they are, there is a good chance there might be news.

What we need your help with: If anyone finds a source or knows someone who can find out whether anyone on Vechains team will be attending the auto show that would be great.

IMPORTANT: even if nothing is announced I think this news is going to be more mainstream in the crypto world probably three days before the event.

A lot of streaming sites don't work very well.

I got a lot of backlash with a lot of people saying ""Duh, it's an ad site, it's a feature not a bug"" which was frankly surprising to get such a ignorant response from the reddit community, since it's all complete BS. These ""ad sites"" don't show any ads, just a heavy browser app that seems to works 1 out of every 6/7 times I try it. Streaming sites/porn works sometimes, not all the time. It has nothing to do with shields, just sometimes it doesn't work on Brave. 

Google Ads, Facebook Manager etc are heavy browser apps, they're not ads. And again, it works once every 5 or 6 times I go on there. 

Basically, Brave is buggy as hell and not even close to Chrome. It will never compete with Chrome. Joining Chrome is their only option and that'll never happen.

Me i bought at 11K, sold at 6K for a loss. To be honest , i am not seeing this going up anymore (within 5 years) . Its time to stop.

All of the “optimist” here in there are just bag holders waiting to dump at 10K . And if BTC price is based on the “demand” then its just gonna be dumped and dumped again .

It was a bubble , im just being a realist here. People keep telling the “greater fool” buy the fuckin dip, just to unload their own steaming pile of bags.

Name one decentralized app that you use everyday. How can you even say its a “technology” when loghtning network that has been promised for years is still not working and did not improve the TPS of bitcoin, not a bit! (Pun intended)

All thiis ETH dapps are just for gambling, all this TRX dapps are just for gambling , what the fuck is the use of it . I dont even have money.

All this “to move 100,000,000,000 dollars” you only have to pay 0.1 cents. Well who gives a shit! I dont have enough money to move , and if i have a million dollars , i wont be giving a fuck about thousand-fuckin-dollars  “transfer fee” from banks just as long it gets to where it supposed to be , and have a peace of mind that if ever i get hacked, the funds are secured.

Store of value? How the fuck can this be the gold when some “imaginary” whale dumps a 1000 bitcoin and the price tanks ? How can this be a store of value when im being taxed by the government for trading this ? 40% per trade btw. 

Whats the use of this? We got ETH, ETC ,Eth Gold and the list goes on and on and on. Whats the difference? I dont know what, the “technology?” ,

In conclusion, i was drunk with the whole kool-aid of cryptocurrency and now im sobering up.

Remind me in 5 years or when the promises of a “decentralized” world comes to fruition..

I see tons of projects that say good team, good tech, whatever and it generally makes you feel like a post with 1000 upvotes about a coin where somebody did the research for you is a great investment opportunity.

Now, I'm sure there have been posts about RaiBlocks like that before but in all I've seen a common thread that hasn't been present in all the prior shills I've seen on this sub. There is a focus on the technology. No, not saying that the tech is great, revolutionary, etc. in one written up post that doesn't actually show it's technology off but in fact there are so many posts I've seen that show how powerful the technology behind RaiBlocks actually is. I've seen speedtests and ""free"" tests that show off how it handles transactions for free. I've seen posts explaining the PoW concept that makes the whole system work. I only have just started getting involved in RaiBlocks a couple of days ago, but I can already tell this coin is unique in that people actually care about what it does. 

For all of the IOTA shilling there was never many actual demos that I saw even though the concept ""instant and free"" applies to both in terms of what they are trying to accomplish. RaiBlocks is working and I am always looking forward to the posts that show off its powerful technology.

As another user recently posted, here is a tweet from December, but there are plenty of other examples: https://twitter.com/nanocurrency/status/939659413614456832
I think it's a fair question to ask what due diligence was done by the Nano/RaiBlocks team before sending a vast number of users to this exchange where many of them would end up being unable to withdraw the majority of their funds due to withdrawal limits and outages prior to the insolvency?

Again, I'm not disputing that Bomber is culpable for this mess, but I don't think the discussion should end there.

EDIT: Due to some people misrepresenting my point; It's the official endorsement that I'm talking about.

* Red Pulse ICO outage, 4 minute outage (unexplained)
* Trinity ICO outage, 25 minute outage (unexplained)
* March 2nd outage, 2 hour outage (communication bug with consensus nodes)
* March 6th outage, 20 minute outage (unexplained)
* 3 outages over March 8th-9th. One outage was a couple hours long (apparently a planned upgrade but no one in the community was informed. Users were also experiencing blockchain syncing problems. Users who sent NEO to and from exchanges didn't receive their NEO. A Binance representative said that the NEO blockchain was ""under maintenance"")

If this was a planned upgrade, the devs need to provide the community with a heads up. Also, we need an explanation as to why the upgrade will cause the network to go down for long periods of time and full nodes to not be able to sync.

Furthermore, it looks like users still cannot send or receive NEP 5 tokens. Some users are still missing their sent NEO from yesterday's debacle.

Initially, Bitcoin’s appeal to me was not to just to be able to send money globally, “fast”, for a “fair price”, “with no intermediary” – most of which I now know to be untrue. Bitcoin mainly represented the liberation from the system of financial control established by debt. It was the fact that no one would be able to profit from the money system at the cost of others. It was supposed to be a fair money. However, what I observe is that Bitcoin is just a new make up for the system we currently live in. Here’s why.

Banks, the controllers of the global financial market, are able to ever extend their wealth through the use of debt. Debt in its current form is the best investment someone can make, especially if you have the brute power (military might) to enforce your credits. There is no risk of default when you can just beat the hell out of your debtor to get enough assets. Today, when you lend money and charge interest, you are multiplying money with little to no risk. Debt is a mechanism that allows for effortless and endless income. When you lend money, you don’t need to produce 1% more to profit. You transfer the obligation of productivity to another person, that now has the burden to literally create / produce 1% more than they did before, or else lose money to you. Charging 1% interest is waaay easier than increasing production by 1%+. If increasing production was so easy, society would know no poverty.

Even if debtors default and have no assets, banks are still gonna get payed, they just print more dollars, passing the responsibility of the risk they mistakenly assumed into the population, to be slowly payed through the years. We live in a rigged system where Banks suck value out of their “costumers” and are not allowed to go bankrupt due to bad management (like any other company in any other industry). Bankruptcy is natural selection in the market. Bad companies fail, and that is a good thing. It allows the market to restructure itself, to transfer value from inefficient / bad players to more efficient ones, and come back stronger. By constantly bailing out bankrupt / bad companies, we are insisting in a proven mistake, and going against the natural forces of the market, at a very high cost - only to the benefit of the banks themselves.

The current scenario is one where the (i) maintainers of the global financial system (Banks) (ii) profit endlessly and effortlessly (iii) by slowly sucking out value from the network of participants (inflation through debt). What many fail to see is that the Bitcoin protocol reproduces the same aspects of the flawed current system, but with a different format.

The new (i) maintainers of the system (Miners) will profit endlessly and effortlessly (turn on a machine) by sucking out value from the network of participants (inflation by block rewards + wealth concentration through fees). **This allows for value to go to people who produce nothing** (but new ASICS to ensure their monopoly position / status quo). In the long term, if protocols like Bitcoin, which are both centralizing in terms of Consensus Participation and Wealth, become predominant in the economy, we won’t correct / fix the mistakes we currently observe, but only enforce them.

If only new network participants could be equally rewarded, it would be fine. However, the system is so broken that the barrier for entry is too high – and so are the costs of keeping up with competition, forcing many miners to LEAVE THE ECOSYSTEM. Today, only a few people are able to mine without considerable cost – which will only increase in the future. The centralizing nature of Bitcoin ensures that early entrants in the mining space have an increasing edge over late adopters. This first mover advantage allows initial players to increase their influence proportionally to the growth of the network. As network value raises, they can afford even better and faster computers, increasing their share of the hashpool – creating never-ending centralization spiral. Such concentration is enforced by the open or secret development ASIC miners which are only accessible to a few members of the industry, further increasing the competitive asymmetry between participants. Sadly, a greed based incentive model inevitably creates a breach to systemic corruption and overlapping – which has already taken root.

Currently, there are three main pools in the Bitcoin network, the biggest being Bitmain. Today, it is valued at 14b, and made a Q1 profit in 2018 of +1.1B USD. What many don’t realize is that Bitmain is not invested in the Bitcoin network. It cares not for its tokens or participants - most of the BTC they mine gets instantly dumped in the market. As a COMPANY, ran by businessman, it cares only for PROFIT. They are only invested in (i) Mining the most profitable chains and (ii) HARDWARE sales, which can be used to support any minable blockchain. Bitmain does not support any network but maybe their own (Bcash). If Bitmain wishes to, it can easily cheat BTC-like protocols, create coins from thin air and crash the system. They can do all this and switch to another protocol WITH NO PENALTY WHATSOEVER. They will still be the most sought out Mining hardware supplier in the world. BTC-like protocols are at the mercy of a single company. It is not decentralized, but EXPLOITABLE, UNRELIABLE, FLAWED and DOOMED to FAIL. The fact that those who exert the most power over the system have NO SKIN IN THE GAME whatsoever makes it even worse.

Many say Bitcoin is money like Gold. While they do share many money characteristics, Bitcoin differs from gold in a key one, which originates from Banking: the charging of fees. When you pay someone with a gold coin, the other party receive the whole coin - no part of it gets vaporized and magically sent to the “gods of transactions”. If it did, these people would be the richest people on Earth. What happens in Bitcoin is that miners not only take part of your money for the simple fact of you using it (fees) – they get double rewarded by diluting the value of every other participants Bitcoin by inflating the supply (block rewards). In this sense, Bitcoin is a very costly money, both in short and long term. Although block rewards are programmed to end, transaction fees are a core element of the protocol. Since the system pushes for extreme competition in hashpower, participating effectively in network consensus requires a considerable initial investment

A truly decentralized system would reward every node or user equally. The “meritocracy” argument that contributing with more hashpower = more right to own reward is a shitty one in the end. This flawed greedy rat-race approach does not increase network efficiency – on the contrary, it contributes to never-ending centralization and network cost, both in electricity and hardware.

I love the liberating nature of cryptocurrencies. I was once in love with BTC, but today, I see it does not reflect the fundamentals it seemed to. If BTC ever gets adopted as the global standard money, it will increase wealth inequality and energy consumption – both which I am against. It is a system in which value does not go exclusively to those who are Productive and *de facto* add value to the economy. It allows for leeching, and has the same flaws the current banking system has.

TLDR: True money should be fair and equal. A means of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Not a tool for profit. Profit should be reserved for those who add real value to society.",240

2) shilling of coins is allowed with facts only. No shilling without facts 

3) repeated FUD Should get downvoted!!! Only 1 Post about the FUD situation or news should be enough. 

4) let’s Always keep the positive vibe! 

5) no more old news getting posted. Like this guy who’s gonna post tomorrow that Bitgrail got hacked. We f**** know. 

6) seriously one last thing , let’s stop hating on each other’s coins. If I hold a good coin with future potential and yours is too. Let’s be friends and support each other. Let XRB people be happy with their XRB and Ripple people be happy with Ripple and Bitcoin people happy with their Bitcoins. We’re all adults here ( well not all  of us ) but you get the idea!

Let that fact sink in for a moment. 99.47% of Bitcoin investors own between 0 and 10 BTC.... only. That means 0.53% own everything else. 

You may not think this a problem, but these 0.53% are whales, they are extremely wealthy, and they have the power to move the market anyway they choose. 

The total circulating supply of Bitcoin is 16,821,737. If we remove Satoshi's 1 million premined coins, that leaves 15,821,737. We should also deduct a few that have been lost, like those on hard disks etc. But in any case, it is over 15 million easy.

People often say, that whales can't move the market, but they can. According to our Rich List, our 0.54% own a combined total of 11,386,975 BTC between them, that's 148,966 addresses / people. (perhaps some of these people have multiple wallet addresses) so the actual number of people could be less. 

There are also 108	addresses (people?) that own 2,804,634 BTC !!

Whales people, whales. Now, there is nothing wrong with being wealthy and owning Bitcoin, but the wealth distribution is extremely skewed in the Bitcoin community, unhealthily. 

The rest of us, the 99% have scraps. Literally scraps. Pieces of scraps.

My point, if I even have one here, is that we should be under no illusion who controls Bitcoin, who is driving the price, the dips, the crashes, the ATH's...it isn't us..... it isn't the news or media.... it isn't a series of poorly timed events that coincide with the close of a futures contract....not really, perhaps a little, but the price is driven by whales. 

They have so much Bitcoin in their wallets, they can sell hundreds and it won't make a difference to them.

I think we need to really understand our situation here. Whales, not bottom feeders rule these waters and regardless of how much I love Bitcoin and the principles it was founded on, this ocean is toxic, it is no place to live anymore and I hope that other people will realize this too and swim off to some other place.

I've been following COSS since the exchange first went live and I bought some. I've also followed the exponential rise of both Binance and KuCoin, and I'm a software engineer with lots of experience in the crypto markets, so I'd like to weigh in on all of this. I'm sure I'll get some hate as a FUDsters when people just want to talk about lambos, but I think this dose of reality is needed.

&nbsp;

The first thing that I find alarming is the general consensus on Reddit is that the COSS token will follow the trajectory of BNB and KCS, yet the team has failed to deliver on a useable exchange at this point. To me, it's very clear that COSS has a very weak dev team, and I no longer have confidence that they are capable of delivering on a high quality exchange. KuCoin came out after COSS, and their team has already delivered an exchange that works much better. What's to stop another competitor from doing the same thing, and then another and another?

&nbsp;

**It's clear COSS has a weak dev team**


If you haven't worked in the software industry, you might not see this, but to me it's clear as day. The team has put out an exchange that I don't believe is even good enough to be called a beta. Basic functionality (like buy/sell) fails to work often and the exchange is regularly down. When it is up it can be slow to the point of barely working. No decent, self respecting, dev team would ever allow such a product into the wild.

&nbsp;

**Rolling out UI changes before backend changes is a terrible idea**


If that isn't telling enough of the teams technical abilities, the thing I find most illustrative is that they're tackling a major UI update first, when the exchange is barely useable due to issues handling user load, trading engine bugs, and other things. The UI isn't great, but honestly I wouldn't mind it that much if the exchange actually worked. If this was a solid team of devs, I can guarantee you they would be working 100% on fixing issues with the trading engine and scalability. People will trade on a crappy UI, but people will not trade if the backend prevents them from doing so.

&nbsp;

**It's very hard to turn a bad dev team into an allstar one**


A lot of people that haven't worked in software might not understand why COSS can't just hire a bunch more devs and put out a quality product. While it's not impossible, there are many hurdles they will face in turning their bad dev team into a good one. Firstly, solid devs are going to take a look at the exchange and think twice about working there, because they want to work on quality software. Secondly, it's very hard for people to recruit and hire others who are more talented. How do you interview someone who appears to be vastly more talented/knowledgeable than you, how do you know if they're impressing you or just bullshitting?

&nbsp;

**People are ignoring the issues they have**


If I had a satoshi for every time I've heard someone say, ""but it's in beta"", I'd have a lot of satoshis by now. This excuse is getting very tiring to me, especially when I don't even consider the current quality to be a beta. Also, to me the whole idea of launching a beta exchange is ethically questionable. It's one thing to put out a beta game, but we're dealing with people's money here, you can't just be releasing financial software into the wild that isn't functioning or well tested.


It took me a good solid week to sell my COSS position when I decided to, because of exchange issues. Half the time I couldn't get on the website, and the other half the time clicking the sell button did nothing. That's right, I'd make an order, push sell, and nothing, no error or anything. Upon inspection of the HTTP response, there is an error message about the exchange being too busy, but they didn't bother to propagate that error up to the user. Come on, this is just amateur hour, not a beta. Of course, people were just telling others to keep clicking buy, rather than having a serious discussion about the issues with this exchange. The amount of denial here is insane.

&nbsp;

**The dividend system actually kinda sucks**


Their dividend sounds great at first, until you actually go to use it. Unless you have a huge stake in COSS, you'll be disappointed to find out that the transfer fee to move each non ERC20 dividend token into a wallet is .002 ETH, or about $2.8 today. That means the majority of dividends you get will actually be locked in the contract, because it will cost more to move them than they're worth. I actually had a pretty good sized COSS position, and the dividend was almost worthless to me, so if you're thinking you're going to get rich on the dividends, even if they go up a lot you may be mistaken.

&nbsp;

**The likely outcome**


In the short term, I expect the COSS token will likely get bid up high in expectation of the new UI, and then have a big sell off, when people learn that the UI doesn't fix all the scaling and trade engine problems. In the longer term, COSS may become successful, but it's a long shot to me. I wouldn't be surprised if this whole thing went the way of Mt. Gox, as I really can't trust their security given the quality of their exchange. Or, they might just fade into obscurity as more new exchanges come on the scene with more capable devs.",64

\- Ethereum is at 100&#37; capacity right now and is averaging around 30k unconfirmed transactions.  
\- Ethereum has 15 transactions per second and claims to be a dapps platform but is unable to run meaningful dapps.  
\- Ethereum has been out for years and solutions for these problems are still years away.   
(This is pure negligence or incompetence.)  
\- Ethereum cannot be used as a currency as it is too slow and has prohibitively high transaction fees.  
\- Ethereum requires gas which is absolutely crippling when it comes to being able to run dapps.   
(its a fundamental design flaw that I personally consider to be a 100&#37; show stopper for any kind of quality dapp.)

As it stands right now Ethereum is ironically a multi year ICO for itself right now. Casper and Plasma are years away. The coin is broken and in a non functional state. The Loom network has potential but its a bandaid solution when compared to superior coins that already exist right now and can do much more. 

Steem is a dapps platform that dwarfs ethereum in every possible way. Steem is often overlooked while its the most widely used crypto in existence right now. Its the only crypto that houses multiple social media daps as well as video and streaming dapp capability's. Even Reddit doesn't have video and streaming capabilities and its a centralized application.  Dlive is INSANELY good right now and seems to be improving constantly. Dapps are the future of crypto as it will mark the mass adoption paradigm.

We can try to make an argument that ETH is less centralized than newer coins but the problem with this is that Ethereum doesn't work. If the coin is broken and incapable of being used then it doesn't matter how decentralized it is. On one hand, people can say that EOS had a year long ICO and that is bad while ETH is trapped infinity in a perpetual ICO state with no signs that it will ever be usable for anything substantial any time soon. Casper and plasma are years away.

Its time move on. Its time that this place gets in touch with reality. Its time to bust the eth maximalist echo chamber. Because its dishonest and its hurting people. And its self destructive. Stop investing in coins that cannot be used for anything substantial.",74

They utilise xRapid - which in turn uses XRP - to make settlement times much faster and cheaper.  Yes, yes - xRapid is only live with a few clients, but I'm talking about the theory of Ripple's future plans - to have xRapid be deployed at scale.   

Let's look at XRP:-

- it's available to buy on the open market.  The market sets its value.  There is no counterparty risk.  You buy from a seller on the open market, you sell to a buyer on the open market.  
- it's paired with dozens of fiat currencies you can buy XRP with, and cash XRP out to.  


Let's look at JPM coin:-
 
- you must buy a JPM coin with USD via JP Morgan
- you must also redeem it to USD via JP Morgan
- as you can see, JPM coin has a central issuing authority - it's not available on the open market to buy or sell, and you MUST use USD to buy and redeem these tokens


Can you see the disconnect here? It would be impossible for JPM coin to be used in cross-currency transactions since you have to buy your JPM coin with $1USD, and sell it back to USD! Even if someone says ""no problem, every country holds USD, they can send JPM coins to the destination country's JP Morgan office, have it redeemed there, then convert that USD to their local currency!"" - you're missing the big problem that the sending bank will need a nostro account sitting in the recipient bank to settle the transaction into the local currency. OR, you go through the Forex markets and buy the local currency with the USD you got from your redeemed JPM coins....then you're subject to FX costs and time delays (usually two days, which is one of the reasons nostro accounts exist). 

If JP Morgan want to compete with Ripple, have at it, but they are obviously not competing with Ripple with an internal IOU coin.  If they want to compete with Ripple, they'll need to pick a crypto on the open market to use as their bridge currency to remove counterparty risk, develop software tools to match xCurrent and xRapid, and then market their services to their prospective clients.  JPM coin tells me they are not even INTERESTED in competing with Ripple, but instead want to make their internal processes more tamper-proof and transparent to their accounting department (is my guess).  Of course, JPM milked the publicity, so you can't also rule out it's nothing but (or partially) a publicity stunt.  ",22

Why RaiBlocks is not secure.

In this article I will try to explain why RaiBlocks is not secure and why its technology is any better neither comparable than the Bitcoin technology.

1. Decentralized payments
Decentralized payment networks are, in opposite of centralized payment network like banks, a way to secure your money without having the risk that a central authority could steal your money or manipulate the money in the market. Decentralized payment networks use asymmetric cryptography to ensure that you are the only one who can spend your money.
When you create a cryptocurrency wallet you are given a public key and a private key. The public key allows other people to send you money, while the private key allows you to spend them.  

But how other users know how many money do you have?
To accomplish this, every user of a decentralized payment network must download the entire transaction database which is replicated on the entire network. When you send a payment over the network, it is received by all the users connected on the network allowing them to know your updated wallet balance and allowing them to discard that payment if you don’t own enough funds.

2. Double Spending
The main problem that afflicts decentralized payment networks is double spending: the ability of an user to spend his money multiple times. In the real world, when you pay someone you give him the real cash. In a centralized payment network, like VISA, the central database is updated every time you make a payment, and they will not allow you to spend more money than your balance.
In a decentralized payment network what happens if you send the same amount of money on two users of the network in the same time? Since their database takes time to update for a small amount of time they both will receive the payment and accept it. In a later moment, when the network tells them that you double spent your money, they will cancel the payment, this is possible because every payment is broadcasted to the entire network, not only the receiver.
Without any other security layer, if a malicious user double spends his money and succeeds to block a payment receiver to know that he sent the same money to someone else (or even better, to another wallet of his own), the payment receiver will accept the payment and ship the good. This is so bad, since even a network connection problem could temporarily lead a payment receiver to undetect double spendings.

3. The Bitcoin Solution
To solve this problem, Bitcoin relays on the fact that after you receive a payment you need to wait a confirmation block, the confirmation block tells you that the payment you have received has been accepted by the entire network and you are allowed to spend it. To create a confirmation block, the miners create a list of all the pending unconfirmed transactions and solve a very difficult mathematical puzzle. The miner who solves the puzzle first, sends the block he found with all the list of confirmed transaction and the solved puzzle to the network, the users of the network will check if the puzzle solution is valid and then reward him with some free coins plus the sum of all the payment fees of each transaction in the block. The miners must create a valid list of payments to be accepted by the network, so double spend attempts are just discarded.

In Bitcoin an attacker,  to make a succesful double spending, should not just stop you from receiving a double spend attempt message, but he should also solve the puzzle to create a confirmation block in a reasonable time frame. Currently solving that puzzle with a single computer would take years; at writing time to solve that puzzle a network of thousands dedicated hardware is used, an attacker would require a billionaire investment to replicate that network. Moreover, it would not only need to create one confirmation block but six of them (6 confirmation blocks are required in the Bitcoin network to trust a payment).

Critics of Bitcoin say that all the computation power used to make the Bitcoin network secure is just a waste of energy because there are other reliable and better technologies. Is that true?

4. What is RaiBlocks?
RaiBlocks is a crypto currency that advertises itself as a fast, fee-less and secure currency, unlikely Bitcoin which is currently slow and high-fee (usually requires 1 hour to a full payment confirmation).
But the key point is that Bitcoin has been made that way to guarantee his users a certain amount of security to prevent double spendings. 
 
RaiBlocks completely ignores the Bitcoin technology and relies on a special version of the Proof Of Stake concept.
When you receive a payment in the RaiBlocks network you have to wait a certain amount of time to be sure that a double spending has not been attempted (and remember the first problem, if an attacker stops you from receiving the double spend you would never know!)
When a double spent is detected, the RaiBlocks network starts a vote. Every peer connected to the network vote to accept the payment A or payment B; every user vote is weighted with the amount of his balance. Usually each peer votes for the first transaction he receives. The transaction which the sum of votes reaches the 51% of online amount of currency wins. The winning transaction is accepted by the network and the other one is discarded. (Reference https://github.com/clemahieu/RaiBlocks/wiki/Double-spending-and-confirmation)

The payment receiver, if his network has not been compromised, will then know if he can trust the payment or not, and will ship the good accordingly. This system leads to an unsolvable problem.

5. The Man in the Middle attack.

If an attacker succeeds to put himself between a merchant and the RaiBlocks network he can just filter the double spending payment packets, and the merchant will never know that he is receiving a double spending. The Raiblocks network will discard that payment while the merchant will accept it.



6. Solutions proposed by the RaiBlocks team

a) The merchant should ask a vote for each payment he receives and wait for the confirmation. 
The problem is that the attacker could manipulate the vote by telling the merchant that only his peers are connected to the network thus he will win the vote by filtering only his votes. Plus, asking a vote for each payment would cause a huge increment of bandwidth usage that many peers could not handle.

b) The merchant should have a remote node verifying the payment.
The attacker could just attack that network too. 

c) The merchant should ask the RaiBlocks.net website if the payment has been accepted.
The attacker can hack the RaiBlocks.net website. Also if you have to rely on a website you can no longer consider RaiBlocks a decentralized network.

Other solutions

1) A payment to be accepted should require a vote with a minimum weight quorum.
It's difficult to establish a correct quorum, and if that quorum is offline no payments will be processed.

2) A payment need to be accepted by some trusted representatives.
This will stop the network on being decentralized. Also, if those representatives are offline the payments are not processed.

7. Why Bitcoin is not vulnerable to this type of attack
Simply because an attacker, to be trusted by a merchant, would require to solve a very difficult puzzle for six times. An attacker cannot alter the difficulty of that puzzle.

8. Other observations

a) RaiBlocks is just Bitcoins without the Bitcoin securing algorithm. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, describes the double spending problem in the original Bitcoin paper: https://Bitcoin.org/Bitcoin.pdf. The developer of RaiBlocks just thinks to solve the problem by ignoring the problem.

b) The official representatives of the RaiBlocks network own more than 52% of total voting weight, allowing the developer to manipulate every vote on his will.

Especially now in the good season many people travel by boat instead of car or bike and some even move there on cabinato boats. 

So you can imagine the trash has increased and has endangered the already poor life of the wildlife in the city. There has been a big issue with swans this year, ducks are also in a bad shape and please let’s not mention life underwater, which is in a dire situation due to overfishing.

With my company we have left 1000 used bottles of glass or plastic in the water. Doesn’t that increase trash, do you think? No!!! How is that possible? The bottles are sealed and contain the seeds of a wallet containing 50 euro each (value about one week ago). After a test phase of about 3 years we will take the money from the wallets. Otherwise if you find it move it to another wallet where we don’t have access.

What’s the gain for my company? They just wanna throw 50K in the trash? Well, we are involved in keeping Berlin’s water clean, so if people find the bottles hopefully they’ll pick up some other trash and don’t urinate around or throw trash on the road, which by the wind can end up in the water.

So, please have fun and keep me updated! Let’s start the treasure hunt!",48

Chainlink is the most recent demonstration of how token sales can offer incredible opportunities that are otherwise accessible only to VCs. 

Now Crypto's most recent unicorn, Chainlink is an example of how token holders need to strain for developments that have a reasonable product-market fit, along with a token that rationally fits into the ecosystem. Chainlink is now one of the first tokenized projects to work side by side with major global companies and then turn that value into a token's price appreciation.",91

Hype aside it's a minor change that's very similar to transaction chains in Lightning Network or Raiden, offering similar advantages (asynchronous) and disadvantages (lower security), although with higher global storage and bandwidth costs compared to typical blockchains with them.  
Where iota breaks down is assuming that a model with everyone mining their own transactions can work.  

What PoW means in practice is that cost spent on mining = security. Ie. $100 fees per hour? Spend >$100 (in energy used for mining) to rewind these transactions. Requiring access to asics is an additional security advantage.  

The reason PoW currencies currently work is because cost is shared among every owner due to inflation - with it, total cost per tx in bitcoin is $81.91. Iota is economically almost exactly like Bitcoin without any block reward, which requires every transaction to pay a very high fee (in energy used for mining) for a reasonable security.  

**Firstly**, it requires every iota sender to be _able_ to do that - which means high-speed hardware capable of mining and access to required energy. A premise fundamentally incompatible with light IoT devices.  

**Secondly**, the fee market doesn't work due to the free rider problem. In the block model high-fee transactions share their fees in a block for one common security. In a dag model transactions close to the tip are losers with previous transactions freeriding on them, which means paying a high fee offers no incentive to get included in any future transaction. 
Which means everyone is going to use low fees (=low PoW expenditure) hoping that a high-fee transaction confirms it, or lots of other low-fee transactions. Which means no high-fee transactions, which means no security at all. 

**Thirdly**, it's all fundamentally incompatible with the premise of cheap transactions. One million transactions with $0.001 fee only add up to $1000. Which means they all can get forked (tangled?) away easily even by one motivated individual. 

That's why there's a coordinator. It's never going away. The fundamental design is hopelessly broken.

There's no inflation so there's no new supply selling on the market, ownership is extremely centralized (ie. few whales own almost everything) and few speculators care or understand why iota can't work. So it can moon. Just remember that it's fundamentally a bad product and if you buy you're only looking for a bigger fool.  

Microsoft/whatever/ partnership - big companies like the coordinator idea because they can envision themselves in that position, charging fees for use. Even if they actually do use iota, that absolutely doesn't mean it's going to be profitable for iota holders - at best, they are going to use iota's _code_ for their private network(s), with pointless PoW yanked out, rather than the current public iota network.

How do we find those true gems in the swamp of crappy projects, outside the top 100 on CMC. We all agree that true millionaires will be made with low caps, suddenly popping up, unexpected out of nowhere. But why should it be out of nowhere? How to look for that specific one?

Will there be gains made on Ethereum and Chainlink? Absolutely, and most likely massive too. But what I’m looking for is a project, which basically is common knowledge to be legit, but massively forgotten, while this team has been building and making connections. 

The true gains are made with low cap coins, below 5m Market Cap, and there are some gems out there, like Morpheus Labs, LTO, Quant. They might give great profits in the future, but it is nothing compared to the profits that could be made with Unibright.

Let’s sum up some reasons why Unibright will be one of the biggest gainers in the next Bullrun for Altcoins. I have studied the telegram, interviews and especially the updates lately, and this week Stefan Schmidt placed this on the TG, and the below comments are my thoughts on it.

**Stefan Schmidt:**  
*Hi Community,*   
*This week we work on some partnerships established over the last months. We are preparing official partnership announcements as well as meeting potential future clients together with these partners.*  
*We also expect some regulatory feedback this or next week on our tokenization cases.*

**My thoughts:**

1. Coming partnership announcement with Digital Assets. Unibright is already named as one of the partners. [https://digitalasset.com/solutions/#a-s5](https://digitalasset.com/solutions/#a-s5)  
Unibright’s attitude has so far been; ”Build, no hype, don’t overblow news before something is finalized and announced by both parties.  
There has not been any official announcement on this, but it has been hinted in the Telegram, as well as in the tweets from Digital Assets. Unibright and DA gave a presentation during Synchronize Europe in June of this year.
2. The Unibright Platform for Tokenized Securities. For the last eight months, Unibright has been hinting that they are building a Platform for Tokenized Securities. The platform allows companies to create their own STO, users can trade security tokens, build portfolios and the platform offers a liquidity solution. This will be a platform that can also be fully integrated into any company’s IT structure. A simple approach for companies to release equity, all compliant with regulations simple to use, drag and drop template, so no coding/developers needed! It is hinted in the TG chat that it will be revealed somewhere in Q4, so watch out for that. And yes, because it is built on the Unibright Framework, for this platform to work, it needs the fuel of the Unibright Framework, which is the UBT token, as was told by Stefan, CTO of Unibright.
3. Any tokens that will be used will NOT return to the market, as stated in the Unibright Token Model. Basically the same principle as a coin burn. [https://medium.com/@UnibrightIO/unibright-answers-the-unibright-token-model-7f849875662c](https://medium.com/@UnibrightIO/unibright-answers-the-unibright-token-model-7f849875662c)
4. We have all seen what happens with many crypto projects lately. The SEC has been pretty strict, and most likely regulations will hit others too. The volume might be low, but at least we are sure that everything Unibright does is 100% legit. Compare that to a lot of the wash trading being done nowadays.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wjbzbkdlxav31.png

One of the issues is the volume, and exchanges. Unibright is listed on Idex and Hotbit, which isn’t great, and volume isn’t great with both as well. But here is where the patience comes in. If you are willing to wait for maybe a year, and just stock up on this little rough diamond, while it is being cut to perfection, you won’t be disappointed. Exchanges and volume will come in due time, but then you missed out on the absolute gains.

To leave you all I give you this couple of seconds from the talk that was done by John Wolpert from Consensys and two others. It is the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, and they are talking about the Mainnet Initiative.

When asked about interoperability solutions it is asked :”Is the Ethereum Mainnet Initiative making Ethereum suitable for enterprises? John Wolpert clearly mentions that Unibright AND Chainlink are participating. ([36 minutes in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svN3g9IanNI&feature=youtu.be&t=35m44s).)

Is this huge? Up for you to judge. But whenever you can find a gem like this with only a Market Cap of 1,6 million USD, at least you’re buying into a legit diamond in the rough.

I’m safely back home and it’s all because of Crypto.,"If anyone remembers, few months ago I lost my job and couldn’t afford to pay my debts anymore in the country I was working in.

The loan I took was to buy crypto in 2017 during the crazy bullrun we had. 

Long story short, after making a Reddit post, many of my working colleagues recognized me in that story and gathered almost 30000$ to help me not going to jail as it is the sentence in UAE for not honoring your debts.

With those 27000$ to be accurate, I bought bitcoin and Ethereum that were much lower at the moment I received the money and decided to go all in to save my ass for good.

It’s been a working bet because now I’m all clear! I paid the bank that canceled the travel ban on me and went back home to start a fresh new life. I manage to refund the people who helped me, some refused but few of them who gave many thousands on their own recovered them even tho they didn’t expect it.

Thanks to you guys who supported me, and even the ones who insulted me with all their heart, I don’t have bitterness towards you.",62

Since there now is an incentive to post what most people favors, it has incentivized more and more Bitcoin posts which acts as a feedback loop - Clearly this has favored Bitcoin and this forum is slowly transforming into another Bitcoin-only Reddit.

Bitcoin was first.  Because of that, many of the older exchanges still have the default currency pairings for fiat and other trading using BTC.  
 
This is a problem for the entire crypto industry.  Why?  Because the fees for Bitcoin used to be low and convenient.

We (collective ""we"") are trying to get mainstream investors and the ""average joe"" to try out investing in cryptocurrency.

What will be their first encounter?  
 
FEES
 
The current average fee for Bitcoin is $30. (https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m)  That means that if you want to grab a $4 dollar coffee at Starbucks and pay with Bitcoin, you're now out roughly $34.  I hope that coffee tasted good! 

Contrast this to XRP.  The current minimum fee is 10 drops for network usage. That means that you can pay for a coffee and not notice any fee associated with the transaction, because it's literally a small fraction of one penny.  This fee structure also beats all traditional methods of payment such as Visa.  
 
SETTLEMENT SPEED
 
Most exchanges require six conformations (blocks) of the Bitcoin network before they will credit a trading account with spendable value.  This process takes approximately one hour at present.  (https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3m)
 
Contrast this settlement speed with XRP, which settles in less than four seconds. (https://ripple.com/xrp/)  After pressing the ""send"" button on an XRP wallet, by the time you tab over to your trading account, it should already be waiting for you!
 
CUSTOMERS SHOULD PETITION EXCHANGES
 
We are the paying customers of the crypto exchanges that we use.  It's up to users to make their preferences and voices heard - and we should do so when it comes to XRP, no matter which coins you are trading.  XRP is the coin that will support profitable, productive crypto trading well into the future - let's pressure the exchanges to use a cryptocurrency that can scale to global levels of usage, keep fees low, and deliver value in under four seconds.

Point is you need to look at what is happening on a minute to minute trade if you want to know what is the real state of BTC ( and really all of crypto).    
Manipulators don't care if it ultimately goes down or up.   
As long as their constant up and down movement they are making money.   
So you can sure there will be either a massive single or perhaps upto 3 down movements to bring BTC back down around 6000-61000 in the very near future.

    a dishonest scheme; a fraud.


First of all, let me start with off with this. No one wanted Bitcoin Cash to exist, no one wanted another Bitcoin subreddit to exist (/r/BTC). 


This is how Bitcoin Cash was forked off & the reasons.


In 2015, the plan was made by the Bitcoin Core developers and the community supported it. This plan was to increase the blocksize. He [said](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7l0oey/reminder_core_developers_used_to_support_8100mb/) in 2015, 2MB now, 4MB in 2 years, 8MB in 4 years then re-assess.


The plan was very simple. Increase the blocksize, lower fees for everyone, more transactions possible. But this changed in 2015. 


The Moderators of /r/Bitcoin, particularly **theymos** who not only controls /r/Bitcoin but also Bitcoin.org and BitcoinTalk.org, decided to censor pro-bigblocks supporters (which was technically everyone because no one knew of any other solution that would work right now). The effects were there. Bitcoin users left in 2017 as the fees rose too high, while the others remained hoping that a solution would be found or they shifted to BCH or other coins. 

This led to BTC losing their market cap percentage and led to other altcoins to rise. 

Core developers have said that Segwit and Lightning is going to solve the problem. Lightning was said in 2015 December to be released in 2016 [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eelga/remember_how_lightening_network_was_promised_to/), [2](https://www.twitter.com/starkness/status/676599570898419712). 

Segwit is not a long term solution and will weaken Bitcoin's security. It allows more transactions but it is irreversible. You can't go back to non-Segwit after using SegWit. 

Lightning is very centralized and complicated. It requires you to be online 24/7, have your [private keys connected to the Internet](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7niwcs/wait_what_my_private_keys_need_to_be_on_an/) and requires you to first do an on-chain transaction to open a channel.

To even get the community to believe that lightning and segwit is a solution, they had to censor the main channels (/r/Bitcoin, Bitcoin.org and BitcoinTalk.org)

Bitcoin Cash is not BCash, B Cash, Bcash, Bitchcash, Bitcash, BTrash. It is Bitcoin Cash (BCH). [This](https://bcash.games) and [this is Bcash](https://bcash.com.br), [this is BTrash](https://btrash.io)

BCH is not controlled by the 'Chinese' or 'Jihan'. A substantial amount of mining is done outside of China. The same can go for BTC, where BTC has got about 70% of their mining done in China.

BCH was not forked off by Roger Ver or Jihan Wu, they are only promoters, investors and people that create products for Bitcoin Cash. BCH was forked off by a group of miners including Amaury Sechet. 




BCH is entitled to using the name bitcoin because it has the genesis block in it and because it is loyal to the original Satoshi whitepaper where bitcoin was first mentioned/coined.

BCH can definitely scale on-chain at least for sometime. Right now at 24 TPS. It can scale with bigger blocks. Centralization will not occur. Satoshi already mentioned that big servers with hashpower would be the ones mining while users will remain users. SPV is a solution for users, while miners will run a full node (copy of the blockchain and hashpower), while business, hobbyists, researchers and others can choose to run SPV or relay nodes (nodes that have the copy of the blockchain but do not have hashpower at all)

Roger Ver raging publicly or being a felony isn't an argument to say that BCH is controlled by him.

If you don't like BCH, it does not make it a scam. Just don't use it.

If you find Roger Ver or Calvin Ayre a controversial figure, that also does not make BCH a scam.

If you find Coinbase expressing their support towards BCH, that does not make it a scam.

If you know that there's a better coin in your opinion, that does not make it a scam.

**TL:DR : Bitcoin Cash is not a scam because no one is being robbed. It was forked off because Bitcoin's development was hijacked by Bitcoin Core. Fees were getting high and solutions that aren't out yet were being proposed, while a solution that's ready isn't proposed. If you don't like it, simply choose not to use it.**

Imagine a crypto that:

* achieves interoperability through a simple smart contract. 
* allows real-world companies to tie into blockchain for real-world usage as needed
* allows dapps to be built through APIs 
* is not limited to one blockchain as most are (the coins usage is limitless)

Chainlink has been racking up partnerships and has many developers using it on and off the blockchain. It is one of the few coins that can be used by any other crypto for development. 

When the nodes go live they will actually be used (because it is a middleware) unlike most other cryptos limited to their specific blockchain. This is a good example of a successful project with many of the top crypto leaders behind it.

This is one of the few coins that could potentially be worth 1000s per coin because its use-cases is limitless and each coin will be used for a use-case. I would imagine at some point Chainlink will be such a monster they will need to offer more coins. 

Call this a shill but I call it informing you and celebrating at the coming of the crypto messiah.

Most cryptos coin usage are limited to one blockchain while Chainlink is not limited to any. This is why the coin will actually be used.",49

You can imagine how hard it was to get there and what sum of money my parents paid for my studying. Can't say I was obsessed with being a doctor, but I was quite interested at that career path. All my friends knew that I was studying medicine. I was given some kind of respect for that.  I'd even say girls  saw potential in me and treated me better than before.

I was smart enough, so I did not have serious problems while studying. It was hard, but I managed to pass all the exams and had never been on the edge of being expelled or something like that.

Everything was good and stable, my future was defined.

Than came November-December of 2017. And every mass media in the world started talking about Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain only.

One of my friends was VERY interested in that. A very ambitious buisnessman-type guy. He had always been much more self-aware than me, so I always considered him to be an authoritet. I listened to his opinions.

He sold his car and took a 10k credit. He invested all that in different cryptos. It was at December. SO I won't describe all the details, but he was lucky. He managed to make profit of something like 14000 dollars from his trading and investments. Spent many time on crypto exchanges, read BTC price predictions and all that. Listened to Ian Balina analytics and that guy from [https://hitbtc-review.net/](https://hitbtc-review.net/)

So I became interested too.

I read a lot of market analytics. I saw every kind of predictions, that BTC price would be $50000 the next month, that financial system would collapse in 2018 because everyone would start to use Bitcoin only. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BRAIN, BUT I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT CRYPTO 24/7. I thought that I was loosing my chance of becoming rich, while wasting time at school. So i left it.

WHAT ARE THE RESULTS??

It is June and I made something like $3000 of profit for half a year of trading. Well, it IS NOT A CAREER PATH. It's interesting to trade from time to time, but DO NOT TAKE TRADING SO SERIOUSLY!!

DO NOT LEAVE your SCHOOL or JOB! Income from trading is not stable. You should consider it as additional income, not the main one. I left school and I didn't find another career instead of that!! I won't be a professional trader. YES, I HAVE $3000, THAT'S COOL. BUT I LEFT MEDICINE FOR $3000!! I AM SO STUPID.

Also do not trust those shills who give you inadequate prognosis and say that you'll become rich  doing nothing. You should find a reliable source of market information and predictions.

Crypto made some people rich, but now the market is in correction stage. So unless you are VERY lucky, it is hard to make enormous profits. BUT you can make trading your way of additional income. IMO, that's possible. You work and you trade on the weekends, for example.",80

Ripple has a very advanced and well connected team along with very rich and powerful backers. Ripple is being heavily adopted by more bigger and bigger banks on the daily , these banks who are now partners of Ripple control all the money and politicians in the world. The technology and real world use of XRP is astonishing , this is also the only coin regulators are not targeting and if you pay attention has been shadowed out of every negative cryptocurrency post you can find. Ripples connections have drastic amounts of influence along with a incredible project which will save powerful groups of people billions , they are going to be the next big thing in crypto. (members of their board of directors are involved with big financial institutions and MoneyGram partnership) . Don't let this opportunity pass by you, FUD created by manipulation and weak hands has given you a second chance to get in the hovercraft to Mars . 
This is the money that is going to flow into XRP in the next year, the majority of the circulating coins are held by newbie investors who panic sell when they see a dip. The price will see a huge increase to 10$+ (this is why ripple is holding 60B XRP in reserve, for their partners to purchase) and continue to grow at a high rate, likely overtaking BTC this year (Likely to be next few WEEKS) ",61

If wraith releases and it works doesn't that make verge more private then Monero because of ip masking? Verge is also a faster coin and the option to use the public ledger will make it a lot more mainstream then monero. 

The only thing left to debunk is the ""wraith is a scam"", if it comes out what's left to hate on?

Are the people that like the verge tech really the ones that are misinformed? Or is this just bandwagon FUD?

3. Waltonchain doesn't have a marketing team and their promotional activities were legit, I received some tokens myself! Their MainNet has also been out for a year, and those ERC20 tokens you see... Well you're stupid, it's a working product. 

4. Credits and Matrix AI Network got millions of transactions per second on their open source testnet all while their code is private!

5.  DeepBrainChain will overthrow AWS, it's already 85 percent less costly than using AWS. 

6. ICON is working with the Korean, Chinese, United States... government!

7. Dentacoin should be worth way more than a couple billion because it will be the go to coin for dentists!

8. REQ is backed by Y Combinator, Y Combinator doesn't just make products, they'll shove it down your throat! Y Combinator will make REQ overtake Paypal soon. 

9. Net Neutrality might come to an end! Buy Skycoin and Substrantium as they'll be the new internet everyone uses.

10. Oyster Pearl will replace every database possible. It's much cheaper than using Dropbox or Google Drive although it doesn't even work!

11. Wow a ___ subsidiary's partner is working with VeChain on these new product designs! This must mean VeChain is working with the Chinese government that has a partnership with the Taiwan government so all the governments are backing the project.

12. China is openly backing NEO despite the ban on cryptocurrencies!

13. Alibaba is backing and investing in TRON! The Founder went to a University created by Jack Ma and also took a photo with him!

14. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin and was created by Satoshi Nakamoto himself.

A rule of thumb should be that if a team can’t hire a person that speaks proper English, they should be met with high skepticism.

I realize some may think that this is very anglocentric or even xenophobic but like it or not, English is the international language and if you can’t conduct your business in it then you clearly don’t know what the fuck you’re doing with all that money.

July 16th, 2017 Total market cap is $63b, at its lowest price in over 2 months

July 17th, 2017, the next day the market cap flies up to $77b. This is an increase of over 20% in a single day.

The TMC then steadily rose for over 6 weeks to nearly $160b overall for greater than a 250% rally in this period. Shortly after August 27th 2017 the market fell into a decline dropping over $60b. Now what could have caused such a drastic change in market value in such a short period of time? Let's zoom out.

July 17th 2017 At the Twins, the remaining lords of House Frey are poisoned by Arya, disguised as Walder Frey. The White Walkers march toward the Wall, where Tollett allows Bran and Meera inside. At Winterfell, despite Sansa's disapproval, Jon secures the loyalties of Houses Umber and Karstark, who fought alongside Ramsay in the Battle of the Bastards. At the Citadel, Samwell takes restricted books that reveal a large reservoir of dragonglass in Dragonstone, and sends word to Jon. He later finds Jorah quarantined in a cell. In the Riverlands, Arya meets some friendly Lannister soldiers, who consider her intention to kill Cersei as a joke. Thoros shows Sandor a vision in the fire. The revelation leads him to believe in the Lord of Light. In King's Landing, Jaime tells Cersei allies are crucially needed. She welcomes Euron, who proposes marriage to her in exchange for his Iron Fleet and a chance to kill Theon and Yara. Cersei declines, citing trust as a concern, so Euron promises to return with a ""gift"" to prove his loyalty. Daenerys arrives at Dragonstone, the home of House Targaryen, previously occupied by Stannis, with her army and dragons. 

Across the very eventful next 6 weeks the TMC rallied until August 27th 2017 when Night King rides the undead dragon Viserion and melts a section of the Wall with blue dragon fire, allowing the Army of the Dead to march through. This signified the end of the rally for the Total Market Cap and the beginning of the decline until the great rally of October 2017 and we all know how that went.",4

Gold is the standard in the real world for storing money because Gold has thousands of uses outside of currency.  Its value and stability comes from the fact that it can be used as money, electronics, jewelry, medicine, space ships/satellites, science discovery and just a laundry list of other applications that will always keep the demand for gold high.  

Bitcoin on the other hand does nothing well.  Its not a stable place to store your money as it consistently has vast and wild swings in its value.  It terms of usefulness as a currency its inefficient, expensive and slow to use. There are many many coins that are far more suitable for financial transactions than Bitcoin. The only thing it had going for it, was it was the entry/exit point for many people turning fiat into crypto, but that is very quickly evaporating.  

I cant see how anyone can realistically see Bitcoin maintaining its current value and position in the crypto world.  A lot of great projects are on the verge of opening the flood gates for mass adoption and when I say mass adoption I dont mean that people go out and buy crypto to spend/invest. I mean that people will be spending crypto and not even realize they are doing so. When that happens, when I can load up EAs BattleFront 3 and put 200 dollars into the game to buy in game ""crypto"" currency and then send it to another address, Bitcoin is done.  Bitcoin had its moment, it was a great first attempt at crypto currency and its mark will forever be seen. But as better, safer, more reliable and more scale-able projects mature, just like all currency the older forms die off. I think that time is now and while I see a bright future for Crypto, I think we are going to see the decline of Bitcoin from here on.  Im sure lost of people will respond with ""they said that back in 20XX and look at it now"". To that I will say 2019 is a vastly different landscape in the crypto world compared to back then and past performance is not indicative of future performance.   ",54

Here's why:,"I just finished reading all 50 pages of the white paper which can be found here: https://www.telco.in/docs/whitepaper.pdf

I think there are several points worth noting:


1. Telcoin is currently in communications with the Central Bank of Tunisia for TEL adoption. Tunisia , a North African nation, is one country among all in the region whose currency is largely at risk to cryptocurrencies because of its close ties to the Euro-zone (Morocco even banned crypto altogether in November). What's interesting about Tunisia is that its capital controls restrict output remittances thereby rendering crypto-exchange virtually impossible. Simultaneously, and this is the point to be stressed, "", a North African nation, is one country among all in the region whose currency is largely at risk to cryptocurrencies because of its close ties to the Euro-zone (Morocco even banned crypto altogether in November). What's interesting about Tunisia is that its capital controls restrict output remittances thereby rendering crypto-exchange virtually impossible.""

2. There are volatility mechanisms for controls; namely, currency forward contracts that lock in the current rate of a destination currency for a fixed period of time - for example, one week. In this case the recipient would have up to one week to convert Telcoin into their local currency at that fixed rate, regardless of any fluctuations in the value of Telcoin.

3. Like VeChain and Ripple, Telcoin offers the potential of complying with global regulatory standards instead of serving as a unit to mitigate them altogether; i.e., ""Take down the big banks!""

4. Black CEO which raises the prospect of interest from investors and venture capitalists in bolstering diversity in the blockchain technology space. Like it or not, this is the world we now live in and is an important social dimension to TEL's future prospects. That, and the project itself is *intrinsically* thoughtful and valuable. 

This is simply a snapshot of what I think are significant aspects to TEL.

*tl;dr: This is a buy.*",15

It seems like mad TRON haters all of sudden, predominantly upset they missed out or are seriously misinformed!

In the hate post by U/skilltroll...(I mean come on read that username and the fact he has never had a crypto post until this one hate post).... there are clearly some misconceptions or blind bitterness being thrown out there. 

First he claims he has made some good gains off this coin, but now suddenly in the day it surges, he is a skeptic. Interesting...what all of a sudden you don’t want your coin you “supposedly” own to grow? Highly doubt he owned Tron to begin with.

Justin Sun, & Tron in China are huge! There market style and way to captivate that audience is different and thus their buzz words/communication styles are different. 

Great Voyage, Star Trek are the names of projects which have deadlines and roadmaps. So not sure what it matters how the project names influence the coins technology?

He claims the game.com partnership is impressive but the website is bad. Well duh, website is under construction. So thanks again for more FUD attempts.

Did we forget that Justin stated he has acquired 20% of the Tron coin supply to be able to burn and eliminate? So why are we crying?

He compares the amount of reviews to the amount of users. How about looking at the apps rating vs the amount of reviews? Peiwo has 4.5 stars/5.

Worst part is he compares multiple codes to Tron and claims it’s a copy. If you research for yourself, you’ll see they are different and the codes are unique. 

Look, in the end do what you want with your money, but this is why I love Tron and will continue to invest in it:

Tron is a decentralized entertainment platform. The basic vision is simple but fucking amazing! 
Ultimately imagine posting a video on YouTube and having your viewer watch an ad prior to your video. Well in this scenario, YouTube made some ad money, but with Tron you can be paid directly for your own content! This is revolutionary and only scratches the surface of so many more things to come! 

If you don’t want your Tron, by all means donate your Tron to me! I’m poor and every bit helps! 
I believe in this coin and I’m not afraid of this garbage FUD!  

If you’re stupid enough to dump Tron to me:

TRON DONATION ID:

Your USDT has enormous risks, yet you're paying the same amount as you'd pay the US government for USD-backed debt. Literally no one can redeem 1 USDT for more than 1 USD, so there is 0% upside, unlike normal debt that pay interest. Even the fucking US government pays interest on short-term USD debt!

You're pretty much saying that Tether is just as likely to be able to return your USD investment as the country who actual issues USD. There is a reason that people who issue USD-denominated debt pay interest and that their debt can often be worth less than face value. RISK!

Tether takes USD, they claim they'll give you USD back, they don't pay interest and they can't actually print it. Why the fuck are you paying $1 for no upside and huge downside?

- Getting money in a game like this seemed easy. But do you really think that you can join this late and still get some? Look at all the channels. People have no clue about cryptocurrencies. All I find are people shilling and whining about drops. A sick pump like in december won't just recover after such a short amount of time. All of us steal the money from each other and you can bet your ass on it, that the ""professionals"" are more intelligent in those topics than you.
- The hype for blockchains didn't stop, but the price is already down 5-10x. What do you think will happen, when companies realize, that you don't need a blockchain to replace your good old database? There is almost no use case for a blockchain from a business perspective. Yet huge money is invested, mainly issued by business people, because they want their business to look innovative. But what happens, when the world realizes, that it doesn't need a blockchain for every task?
- Blockchains are completely useless as a base for a currency. It grows like cancer and nobody can shrink it. Who wants that? Bitcoin for instance: Every 10 minutes, a block is created. Wow. 7 TPS? Seriously? Ppl know that and they still invest huge amounts, believing that this is the future?! This market is completely insane.
The disk size of ethereum will soon lead to centralization, because who has a multiple TB HDD in his home server? Look at this old thread, where a dude is already complaining: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/721kf2/running_out_of_disk_space_due_blockchain_size/
- Idiots with no idea about anything usually don't get rich. That's just a general rule. If you don't know anything about the blockchain and can't even argue about your investment, you might be amongst them. Pumps and ""free"" money always brings new people, but guess what... It's not fee money. We are basically playing against each other and not everyone can be the winner. Especially now that the herd is here and we don't at least get some new monies.
- The next bullmarket might come, when there is real-world use. This will take a lot of time from here, I guess. Everywhere out there, only concepts exist. Some coins are a bit further than others, but the only use case for cryptos at the moment is a ""future"" investment and the (almost) only transactions that happen are exchange <=> exchange and cold storage <=> exchange. Where is the adoption?
- There are still too many people in the communities that don't have a clue. The shakeout can't be over yet. Remember 2013? How long did it take to recover? And don't you think, that the older this market gets, the more the waves will calm and the longer the distances will get? Who knows if 2 years isn't extremely optimistic.

To correct myself a bit: I see adoption happening on some coins, only a few of course. And I see a lot of management talk about stuff every sane person should know, that it only sounds good within the first two seconds you hear it. I do believe that some will surpass previous ATH. But I am kinda sure that most of your coins won't come even close to where you bought within the next 2 years (or even ""die"" during that period). But to really get there, those coins will have to deliver real improvements and new tools and ideas.",37

Specifically:

* For a poll to pass, its winning option needs to have enough Moons to meet a decision threshold. This decision threshold will be set to a minimum of 10% of the Moons supply to start with.
* The decision threshold will automatically update once a week. At that time, the new decision threshold will be calculated as the average of the existing threshold and the number of Moons cast in favor of the most highly-voted option in governance polls over the last 4 weeks. There will still be a 10% minimum of the existing Moons supply (it can't go lower than that).
* When you create a poll, there will be a new flag to mark it as a governance poll (compared to regular opinion polls). These are the polls that will be used to make decisions and to update the decision threshold. If you are making a poll on Moons distribution, you will need to mark it as a governance poll.
* We will be rolling out updates to web and the apps to reflect these changes. They will be rolled out before the next proposed Moons distribution (3 weeks from today).

On a separate note, the leaderboard will also be updated to reflect earned Moons only (currently it also counts Moons received in transfers).

\--

The next distribution of Moons is ready. You can claim your Moons through the Vault in the Reddit mobile app (iOS/Android).

Moons are r/CryptoCurrency's form of [Community Points](https://reddit.com/community-points), a way for users to be rewarded for their contributions to the subreddit, and they can be used on premium features in the community.

This distribution is based on karma earned from 2020-09-30 to 2020-10-27. [Here](https://reddit-meta-production.s3.amazonaws.com/distribution/publish/CryptoCurrency/round_6_finalized.csv) is the finalized list, with contribution scores signed by Reddit (users with no signatures yet do not have a registered Vault. They will be able to claim their Moons when they create their Vault through the Reddit app).

\--

**UPDATE (11/4): We're aware of technical issues with claiming and using Moons. We are working to get it fixed. Your Moons will not be affected, and you will be able to claim them after we get the issue resolved. We will update here when it's fixed.** ",216

It was a pic of someone holding up their paper wallet from a bitcoin atm showing both public and private keys. The picture made me wonder if there were any nearby bitcoin atms, so I did a quick google search and found an atm 20 minutes away from me. I went to the atm and put in 50$ just to say that I had some bitcoin. I signed up for /r/bitcoinbeginners and learned about Coinbase. After signing up with Coinbase, I started researching the ""other"" crypto being offered and learned about /r/cryptocurrency. I started buying eth at 8$ and eventually invested 30% of my net worth in crypto. 

I stuck with eth during lows & highs and yes I do regret sometimes not selling at top during last bull run. This month I decided that I wanted to set a baseline on what I would get with my crypto investment. I sold enough eth and bitcoin to pay off the mortgage to my house and compensate for taxes. Today I went to the bank and turned in my final house payment. No matter what happens to crypto from here on out, I have a house. Paying off the house was never a goal for 2020. Hell, it wasn't even a goal for the next decade.

Do I think ETH will hit above $1400 again? Yes, and it might happen next week or next year or half a decade. I've never doubted the technology. However, getting rid of my mortgage takes an immediate, priceless weight off my shoulders. I work in an industry where layoffs always seem to be on the horizon, and it's hard to get a job when everyone is out of a job. Now I don't have to worry about keeping a roof over my family's head. The relief is euphoric.

I'm not completely off the crypto ride. I still have a good amount of eth left. I'm going to invest a small amount per month back into eth and bitcoin to slowly build my stockpile back up, but I'm not in any rush. I'd like to thank this sub as well as many others for all the knowledge, advice, and entertainment.

TLDR - Paid off my house with cryptocurrency gains. Financial freedom is something everyone deserves.",252

________________________________________________________________

That's right, everyone always talks about their portfolios, let's see if Redditors can pick a portfolio that'll outperform the rest (Or, alternatively, go down in flames) and leave it for a year. At the end of the year (November 5th, 12 months from now till the day) I'll cash out the proceeds and donate it to the 10 people who posted the comments that got the highest upvotes in this post - Or in other words, the people who ended up choosing the Coins that will be bought.

Last cycle, I converted 10,000 Moons into USD for this experiment, now it's up to you to choose what Cryptos it buys.

I will track the experiment here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix2NquwnxQq5GHy9AfJfJaP1SrgdQ19DewuCBUFXRrQ/edit#gid=0


________________________________________________________________

**Here's the deal and the rules:**

- You comment on this thread. You can either comment a top level comment with a coin you think should be chosen, or you can support someone else's pick. If you are doing a top level (Coin pick) comment, **please explain why this coin should be chosen.**

- You list a coin available on Binance.com - It'll be the Casino I'm using for this experiment.

- The top 10 upvoted (In total votes) comments will have that Coin purchased as 10% of the total:

- [0.0353 BTC / 10 = 0.00353 BTC to 10 coins](https://i.imgur.com/S6cTs59.png) - Or about $50 USD/Coin.

- Coins will be purchased in order of upvotes. Will try to divide them evenly but the last place ones might lose out a little bit.

- Coins will be tracked each month in a post, which will coincide with the day after Moon Distribution. I'll try to make it funny and informative.
________________________________________________________________


Before next Christmas, 12 cycles from now, the winners will get the coins distributed to them in the most economical trading pair of their choice - Obviously you want to avoid trading down too many pairs, but we'll figure that out at the end of next year.

So, what are you waiting for? Type your comments in below, and feel free to support your favourite suggestions. Maybe the community loves TRX, or maybe they want to give their newest Microcap a try, it's up to you guys. Hit me with your best.",74

1. These exchanges have NO problem freezing your funds for months and worst case you could lose them.  Do you really think these exchanges have your best interests in mind? Fuck no, they want to look out for themselves. 
2. Withdrawing your coins is GOOD for YOUR coin's price.  We have no proof the exchanges don't run on fractional reserves (remember QuadrigaCX?).  Getting your coins off the exchange means less market manipulation, is healthier for coin price, and gives you peace of mind.

It didn't work as expected and the process was quite hard and my computer too slow so I returned to clicking ads (and using apps that were clicking ads) and other stupid things. 

I never thought it would be actually used like money because the process was pretty hard back then and most of the people I knew were asking me for computer related problems. So .. if it was to complex in my opinion, I thought it would be unimaginably for the average people. 

I forgot about bitcoin and woke up to it valued at 4k in 2017. I didn't bought as I was expecting it to dump. I read about it and the fact that is slow and the fees are high and I said again: ""This will fail"". It hasn't yet, but it is still not what I am imagining a crypto currency should be like. 

The thing is, I never thought about a digital currency could work. Then, in 2017, I read about all this projects using blockchain for different stuff and thought ""HEY! there is a usability after all"". But all this projects have a cryptocurrency attached that acts more like a stock then an actual currency. And many projects try to imagine a perfect digital financial system, because our ancestors failed didn't they? SO many ideas .. staking and all of that ... 

I think there are few that are literally cryptocurrencies ... I think Bitcoin should be more Bitgold at this point and maybe /r/cryptocurrency  more like /r/blockchain",14

Interestingly, if you bought at the last ath and have continued to dca into Bitcoin on a weekly basis, you would currently have almost doubled your investment. In fact putting $50 a week into Bitcoin since that date would have seen you accumulate a little over 1.0 Bitcoin at an average buy price of $7,500.

So it's worth remembering, if anyone is concerned about buying at the current price, thinking 'it's too high' (although the general sentiment here is clearly bullish) a bit of dca can go a long way.

To be honest, I’ve been thinking about Bitcoin for some years now, but this time things took a different approach. Something made me think of Bitcoin in a different way. Many of you say that Bitcoin is great because it fights the banks, or it fights the governments, or it fights the current monetary system based on fiat currencies, or because you make money with it, or whatever. I agree on all of that. Bitcoin and blockchain can make many good things for us but… what about Satoshi Nakamoto? We know nothing about Satoshi Nakamoto, the person or people that created it. However, we know something for sure: Bitcoin is human-made. At least one person created it. 

What are this person’s ideals? Ideas? Political views? Is Satoshi just a nerd in a basement, a political organization or a multinational company? These are not minor issues. Especially if we consider that it is estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto owns 1,100,000 Bitcoin, making him the 70th richest person in the world at this price ($14,300). [If Bitcoin surpasses $100,000 Satoshi will be the richest person in the world](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/), relegating Jef Bezzos to the second place. If Bitcoin reaches $200,000 Satoshi will double the wealth of Bezzos. Making him out of reach in decades. Passive income on steroids.

Now what if Satoshi Nakamoto has an agenda? How risky can be letting a complete stranger be the richest man in the world just like that? Can the crypto dream turn into a dystopian nightmare?

We can trust blockchain, but can we trust Satoshi?",20

Thanks all for your help !


I've been investing in cryptos since mid-2018. I probably made a good dozen of transfer from my bank account to Coinbase to convert EUR to ETH. Amounts were only a few hundreds each time.

Last time I made a transfer, my bank called me to question my transfer, but finally validated it...

Yesterday I tried to make a new one and today my bank called me to explain they will not allow any more of these ""crypto-related"" transfers, stating that it's for their customer's ""best interest""...

I kinda get it : a lot of their clients lost a lot of money making dumb/uninformed crypto ""investment"" and got rekt, blaming the bank for advice !

But now here I am, 2 years into crypto, haven't made a positive profit yet but did not get rekt either. 
I would consider myself as a wise investor, at least as much as one can get in this wild space...

**I wanna keep investing so my question to you guys : 

I still need a gateway bank to transfer and convert my EUR, which ones would you recommend that might be ""crypto-friendly"" ?

I'm wondering how holders of Monero or other privacy coins feel about developments regarding privacy coins, specifically about a few topics:

1. Monero is apparently being banned from exchanges in some countries. So far this seems limited, but given the recent report of [Korea banning Monero](https://thedailychain.com/south-korea-to-ban-privacy-focused-cryptocurrencies-like-monero/) from exchanges and the fact that Netherlands-based exchanges also aren't allowed to offer privacy crypto on exchanges anymore, it seems like this issue is coming to the fore a bit more lately. What are your expectations on this? More bans, or perhaps that some countries actually embrace privacy cryptos?
2. The role of Monero/privacy coins. The way I see it, Monero posits itself as an alternative to cash. It's anonymous, untraceable, an even better replacement for cash. However - it does have a sort of ""criminal"" connotation. Like it or not, a lot of people within the crytpocurrency space seem to think so, and a lot of people in politics seem to think so even more. I don't think Monero is exclusively used for criminal transactions, and I think Bitcoin is actually used for it more, but this obviously seems to be a concern for politicians when it comes to privacy cryptos (see also the [recent comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jks97a/french_minister_of_finance_says_cryptocurrencies/) by the French minister of Finance). Do you see this reputation of Monero/privacy coins as a negative when it comes to adoption because it's associated with illicit activity? Do you see it as positive because it proves its usecase? And as what do you see the role of Monero in the future - as a broad replacement of cash or as a crypto with a more niche function?

I feel like I need to add - I'm quite fond of Monero itself, and do not believe it to be exclusively used for criminal transactions.

Many of us regard investing in cryptocurrency as a form of passive income. Put your money into bitcoin and other alts, hope for the next bull cycle, and let it ride. Make your money work for you, and passively make income. Though this is a great idea in theory, many of us are not treating our investments in cryptocurrency as passive income, and here is why:

&#x200B;

How many of you check bitcoin's price atleast 5 times a day? Does watching your portfolio move up and down hundreds of dollars keep you stimulated? How much time do you really spend looking at your portfolio? Once you answer these questions, you will realize that many of us treat our cryptocurrency investments as full time jobs. Our portfolio's, as well as other cryptocurrency prices, are always on our minds.   


I too am guilty of this behavior. Though I think of my investment in cryptocurrencies as a form of passive income, it is quite the opposite. So, I make this post to have you guys think about the time you spend in cryptocurrency. Is your investment in cryptocurrency truly passive income?",35

The sender's address was inactive for 5 years when the bitcoin price was  \~$200 in 2015. so it's straight 70x in 5 years. 

**Now he owns 0.3743% total supply of bitcoin comparing Microstrategy 0.182% share only.**

We guys are busy talking about Microstrategy and Grayscale but what if we get to know these unknown big wallets also owned by big institutions and they accumulated bitcoins years ago and now they don't want to open up.

**That address comes at 3rd position in this list just 360 bitcoins behind Coinshares.**

When bitcoin starts surging higher this big address starts doing transactions like they were waiting for it for years. what if it gonna dump those bitcoins on others? what's the need to do that transaction from one wallet to another. Is it something like a game plan of theirs to play with normal people sentiments? 

Number of Bitcoins active-address also raised in past months -

In Dec 2017 bitcoin active addresses were at peak- 1,283,917 addresses

Current Active Addresses- 1,118,924

That seller accepted only wire transfers and bitcoin. I first wanted to do the wire transfer but it seems like I have to ask my bank to unlock that wire transfer to that sellers country, so I decided to do the bitcoin since he also offered 10% lowered price if I paid via bitcoin.

Well the ISSUE i have is, i transfered 40 euros to coinbase wallet. And i knew I'd have some fees... What i didn't know is that, transferring 40 euros to the coinbase wallet, took almost a 1 euro away from my money, so I received only 39 euros with some cents.

Next step was to convert to bitcoin, that cost me 1,99€ ....
So o ended up with 37 euros.... 
The thing is, the product costs 36,90 euros....  

So I thought I had barely enough and i was happy, but at the step where I had to send the money, it asked me another fee of almost a euro ..... which means I was something about 70 cents short....
How much is that? Almost 5 euros just so I could pay with bitcoin? Did I make a mistake? Did I use the wrong bitcoin wallet?
Is that everywhere ? I don't see the point in bitcoin now if it costs me more to send via bitcoin just because of coinbase' fees...
Anyone has any info about a cheaper way to pay via bitcoin?


Ps: someone told me to wait for the bitcoin to go up, since I only miss 70 cent... But the value considerably went down instead.... 

Ps: i don't mine nor invest bitcoin since I don't have these resources right now. So it's not like I can wait to get more bitcoin.",21

-Since 2/18/20, every day I have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. I try to make follow up posts within a week, but I am behind at the moment. I try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. Sometimes I even feature projects I personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. I feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. At this point, I plan to try to continue making these posts until I have completed a full year. 

-If you decide to reply, please add something more than, ""scam"" or ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"". Please say why. If it is a scam, link or show evidence. If you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? It seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags. 


-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!

As many of you know, we had a community vote to limit memes and media posts to only being allowed on the weekends. This vote passed and is now in effect. Please limit posting of image and gif links to Saturday and Sunday (UTC time).

# Additional Rules Added About Posting

We have also tweaked one of the existing rules and added an additional rule to try to mitigate spammers and limit people from just spamming 800 memes on the weekend:

* Users can only post content once per 24 hours per domain, news, or  social media outlet - sites caught using multiple accounts to self  promote will be banned and blacklisted. 
* Users can only make a maximum of three posts per 24 hours 

The first rule already existed but was tweaked to include any domain, not just news or social media. The second rule is brand new. These rules will be enforced throughout the week, and will include people posting memes on the weekend. So, a user can only post one link from [i.redd.it](https://i.redd.it) or [imgur.com](https://imgur.com) per day on the weekend, and can post no more than three links per day. 

We're trying to limit people from just carpetbombing the sub with memes on the weekend as well as deal with some folks that are just spamming tons of articles through the week. If you notice anyone breaking these rules please use the report button with a description of why you're reporting or just send us a modmail.",107

Before leaving I wanted to transfer the money I'd saved while working there to my home country bank. When I went to the bank to do this, they told me that I would need my work permit to be able to transfer the money (they had already made copies of my work permit and passport when I initially opened the bank account, as that was a requirement). But because I had already left this job 6 months previously and had been staying in the country as a tourist, my work permit had expired and when I told them this they informed me I would be unable to transfer my money out of the country to my home bank.

Fortunately I was already signed up to a crypto exchange in this country, so after leaving the bank I went back to my apartment, logged into the  exchange and put all of my money from my bank (we're not talking huge amounts here, but it was a significant amount for me) into Bitcoin, so I finally had complete control of my money again.

Now I know this isn't as extreme a situation as those people living under corrupt governments who may face the risk of having their bank accounts unjustly frozen, or those living in a country which has experienced hyperinflation. Perhaps there were ways I could have gotten this resolved. But for me this was the first time that I really understood the true value of the cryptocurrency I had already been holding for a little over a year. Previously, it had been no more than an investment. But now, for the first time I saw first-hand that the money in my bank wasn't really 'my' money. It was the bank's money. *They* had control over what I could do with it, not me. I finally got what people here meant when they stressed the significance of *being your own bank.*

So, whether you're living in a financially unstable country, or you're simply concerned about the amount of money printing going on, what was your crypto 'Aha!' moment that made you really appreciate just how necessary cryptocurrencies are?",79

**Introduction:**

A decentralized exchange is a platform for conducting financial transactions directly and without intermediaries. In a decentralized exchange, no one has access to users' assets and transactions take place without the intervention of centralized organizations. Exchange offices play a vital role in the digital currency market and are known as synonymous with these markets. But the most famous exchanges we know, despite the decentralized nature of digital currencies, are highly concentrated. Centralized trading systems can have full access to users' assets, interfere with the trading process, and block any user account they wish. The only possible solution to these problems is decentralized exchanges. Over the past few months, the development and creation of decentralized exchanges has flourished and we are witnessing the emergence of a large number of them. In this article, we will first explain the concept of decentralized exchange and its various aspects, and then we will introduce the complete BINTEXTFUTURES exchange.

**What is a decentralized exchange?**

Decentralized Exchange, or DEX, is a platform for decentralized trading, using blockchain and smart contracts to eliminate intermediaries. With a decentralized exchange, users can trade from within their own wallets without having to deposit digital currencies into their wallets. When it comes to buying and selling and exchanging digital currencies, minds turn to exchanges such as Bainance. And Kevin Bass goes, and it's not without reason. Their ease of use and popularity have made fewer people feel the need for other exchanges. But the decentralized nature of digital currencies contradicts the way these exchanges work. Hacking and theft, as well as the possibility of assets being blocked, are the main dangers that threaten traders' assets in a centralized exchange. But in a reputable decentralized exchange with perfect coding, these risks no longer exist. In these exchanges, the assets are withdrawn directly from the trader's wallet and no third party will manage the currencies. To operate in decentralized exchanges, you do not need to enter personal and sensitive information and you can only connect a wallet. Use the services of a DEX. However, due to technical problems that sometimes occur for decentralized exchanges, lack of support for all digital currencies, and the issue of blockchain scalability (slowness of transactions), still more than 90% of trading volume. Digital currencies are traded on centralized exchanges, and traders do not currently trust decentralized exchanges as they should. However, in 2020, we saw a significant increase in the volume of transactions of these exchanges, and there is great hope for the future of these exchanges.

**How does a decentralized exchange work like BINTEXTFUTURES?**

Decentralized exchanges are built on free-chain blocks that have the ability to execute smart contracts. Ethereum is currently the largest host of decentralized exchanges. To understand how decentralized exchanges work, you must first become familiar with the concept of smart contracts. A smart contract is software that executes one or more specific commands under certain circumstances. This contract is implemented on the Chinese block and it is impossible to prevent its implementation. The main feature of a smart contract is its final implementation. In fact, what makes the difference between a regular contract and a smart contract is that in a smart contract, no one (even the manufacturer himself) can prevent the contract from being executed, so we do not need to rely on centralized intermediaries to execute it.

Therefore, when a smart contract is executed on a free Blockchain such as Ethereum, it can no longer be stopped and no one can stop it. In some decentralized exchanges, a cash pool is created using a smart contract, so that participants can allocate their assets to the exchange so that the exchange can meet the needs of traders with those assets. In this way, the participants also make a good profit.

**BINTEXTFUTURES**

Futures Bintex is a blockchain based trading platform. This platform, with its various features and services and utilizing blockchain potentials, maximizes the user's profit potential. The exchange uses a unique model in its mechanism through which it will solve a significant part of the problems of digital currency exchange. It also provides an integrated, productive and secure location for its users to have a combination of speed and ease of centralized exchange with all the security benefits of a decentralized system.

One of the key components of the BINTEXTFUTURES ecosystem, which is being used for the first time in exchange offices, is the BintexPay payment system, which offers a valid token, e-wallet and chip cards. This feature is the strength of the Futures Bintex platform compared to other exchanges.

Futures Bintex can be considered one of the best new generation exchanges in digital currency trading platforms that operates in a decentralized and peer-to-peer manner. This exchange has been implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain. In this exchange, smart contracts are used to perform and facilitate exchanges. Another positive thing about this decentralized exchange is the use of dynamic reserves, which allows the network to provide its services to users cheaper by providing sufficient liquidity. This project is developed in India. And has a special digital currency called ""BNTX"", which we will talk more about later.

Apart from the technical details and in general, Futures Bintex goes through the following processes to perform a transaction:

1. The trader connects his wallet to an exchange.
2. Registers your buy / sell order.
3. Other buyers / sellers register a custom order according to the first trader order.
4. Assets are entered into a smart contract, traded in a smart contract, and the amount is deposited in the buyer and seller wallet.

**Bintex Features & Advantages**

Here are the most important benefits of the Future Bintex platform:

**• Security:** It can be said that the most important issue in any business is security. BINTEXTFUTURES ensures the security of users by creating a coherent and dynamic financial system. This platform, considering several layers of security, unique server-side security, hardware wallet, etc., provides all the expectations of users and creates the highest level of security to prevent phishing and DDoS attacks.

**Liquidity:** By creating a dynamic and secure platform, BINTEXFUTURES are promising enough to attract investors, traders, corporate figures, etc. who can actively participate in trading, thus maintaining liquidity in the exchange. In addition, by researching the volume of transactions, their validation, adding tokens and currencies with high potential, the maintenance of liquidity in the system will be guaranteed.

**• Exchange:** BINTEXTFUTURES exchange platform with various features such as spot trading, p2p, DEX and so on. It is also capable of processing 1.5 orders per second, making it the fastest trading platform on the market today.

\-More coins will also be added in the future.

**• BintexPAY Wallet:** Each user is assigned a private wallet to store their digital assets to receive and send assets and make transactions. This wallet creates a separate blockchain address for each type of asset and stores all the information related to the user's assets, business history and payment information so that the user can easily access all the information at any time and when needed. . The BintexPay wallet also allows users to access all encrypted data and charts directly in its structure. This feature provides complete insight into supported cryptocurrencies.

**The BNTX Smart Token**

The BINTEXTFUTURES platform has a local currency called BNTX. BNTX is an ERC-20 token with the ability to improve and accelerate liquidity, a feature that plays a key role in maintaining operating system liquidity when exchanging multiple coins. All users must have these trusted security passwords to participate in fee-based offline markets and increase demand for BNTX tokens. This is also an essential part of the revenue model on the Bintex Future platform. All costs on the platform are paid in BNTX codes only to ensure liquidity and use of passwords.

I talked with the moderator and they approved me posting here!

We are a family business running over 25 years, located in Serbia.

We mainly sell perfumes that are made in Serbia and they are inspired by popular scents. So far we have 3 retail stores in our city and a few franchises in other cities.

They are branded as ""Chez Pierre"" which is our company name. 

Our main goal is to deliver high-quality fragrance for the lowest price possible!

We recently decided to accept **Bitcoin** as a payment method on our website.

The big reason for that is that PayPal sucks ass.

When you are leaving in a country that's not in the European Union, you have limited service of choosing payment methods and if you want to sell it worldwide well PayPal is your only option.

PayPal often time limits your payments, has a reversal hold on every transaction, asks a lot of documentation (which is fine) but their customer support never answers if something is out of a script and oftentimes you cannot even communicate with them. Last 12 months we had twice money frozen without an explanation and it was really hard to talk with them.

Let's not start talking about their fees, they cannot compare to Bitcoin.

Overall it might be easier for the buyer to make a PayPal account and just purchase, but from the seller side, it's really a nightmare. Everyone is trying to avoid them and there is a reason why.

That's why we decided to encourage people to use Bitcoin and we are offering 10% off using code **SALE10** for Bitcoin purchases!

If you are a small business owner start accepting Bitcoin now, it's not that hard to set up and it's very easy to use.

Our website is: [https://shop.chezpierre.rs/](https://shop.chezpierre.rs/)

-Since 2/18/20, every day I have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. I try to make follow up posts within a week, but I am behind at the moment. I try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. Sometimes I even feature projects I personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. I feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. At this point, I plan to try to continue making these posts until I have completed a full year. 

-If you decide to reply, please add something more than, ""scam"" or ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"". Please say why. If it is a scam, link or show evidence. If you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? It seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags. 


-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!

Suppose crypto had a reset. Hypothetical, ignoring the economic collapse it would imply. Every cryptocurrency is reset to a 0 balance but the market cap value is being reinvested Fantasy draft style. All you have to go on is the definition of the coin core values and it’s features; what are you investing in? 

All the coins maintain current features and bugs or quirks. Nothing else has changed except the market cap. Everything starts at 0 and people buy what they want after a presentation from them all. 

Maybe this is a stupid topic but I’m curious about the consumer psychology behind crypto. Why do people value the things they do, why are they invested. I’m a passion investor, not to be mistaken for an emotional investor.",46

First stop Coinbase. Already have an account and already bought from them via credit card. Ok so they dont take credit card anymore, or atleast my credit card. Try debit card, they dont take it aswell. 

Next stop: Bitbuy.ca Apparently a big site in canada to quickly buy crypto. Good, make an account, add funds via interact e-transfer. They give me all the info needed for the e transfer and couple hours later my bank says the e transfer was accepted by bitbuy.ca. I wait.. 24hrs later. Still 0$cad in my bitbuy account  I contact them. Thet say they dont have the payment. I  contact my bank and then interact themself, they both says payment went thru.

Ok so wtf is going on there idk. But i cant wait no more. I want some more bitcoin before election but i cant get some.  I check over at paypal canada but i dont think they offer crypto yet. Or atleast i couldnt find it. 

Any1 has a GOOD canadian site where i can buy BTC in less than 12hrs.

Should be simple, no??? Is this 2014 or 2020. Not sure at this point.",32

If you go to [Ethtrader](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/) in new reddit you’ll see [at the top](https://pasteboard.co/JyytHUx.jpg) their banner is available to purchase in their native community points token donuts. 

The pricing model they adopted is a variant of a [Harberger tax system](https://dzone.com/articles/harberger-taxes-on-ethereum) dubbed the hamburger tax system:

- The person who buys it sets the daily ad price. They can purchase multiple days of banner ad time at a time.

- Anyone can purchase it from them with their Subreddit Points for the price that they set.

- The person who has the top banner pays a tax on it (10% of the one day banner price, daily) for keeping the banner. Set the price too high, the more the owner pays in tax. Too low, and someone may buy it immediately.

- If no one else buys the banner space while the current owner control it, their banner continues to be shown until the amount they deposited for the banner purchase is deplenished.

- The owner cannot refuse the purchase if a buyer pays the price set by the owner.

- When users buy the banner from another user, points go to the original owner it was bought from.

- Tax is burned.

You can read more about it in the [wiki for donuts](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/donuts)

We could adopt a similar model, or just make it a flat cost that lasts for a set amount of time such as:

My story in a nutshell:

I first got into crypto around late-Feb early-March, a couple weeks before the big crash occurred. Cryptocurrency has been something I have always been interested in, but I had never gotten into it before because I had assumed it would be too ""complex"" and ""complicated"" for someone like me, with no knowledge, to just start getting into in one day. But some time around late January, my friend had mentioned to me that a friend of his had possessed some cryptocurrency, and my interest instantly piqued. He couldn't remember what app his friend had used to buy it, but I was blown away by the fact that all you needed was some mobile app to get yourself crypto. 

So I pushed him to ask his friend the name of it, and he is very forgetful so I didn't get the name of it until a few weeks later, he told me it was an app called ""Coinbase"". Of course I instantly went and installed it the second he told me, and I started checking it out. This was before I had joined this sub or done any legitimate research into exchanges, or crypto in general. I made my first purchase not long after that, $50 worth of BTC.

The $50 that started off an addiction. I'm not as consumed by the charts as I was when I first joined, and I have many of you here to thank for that. This sub has helped me more than any other sources on the internet could, and I would like to thank each and every one of you for that, yes even the downvoters and moon farmers.",80

I've been lurking around this sub for a while in order to get a better sense of what crypto is about. It's something I've followed on and off for a number of years, but previously it seemed pretty hard to get into, and admittedly I didn't look into things in too much depth until now.

A few months ago my fiance picked up some BTC on a friend's recommendation, so I subbed here to get more info for her (and me). 

After some consideration, I've decided to jump in too. As a beginner, I'm considering starting with bitcoin and etherium, but just wondering which exchange is best to use for a noob? 

My fiance is using coinbase and it seems pretty straightforward, although I've read Kraken is perhaps better. I also read they got hacked recently though hah. Curious what you guys would recommend. I'm mainly looking to hold (hodl?) for now and then maybe look into trading later. 

TL:DR: which is better for a newcomer that's considering holding for now and maybe trading later? 

Cheers in advance :)

-Since 2/18/20, every day I have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. I try to make follow up posts within a week, but I am behind at the moment. I try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. Sometimes I even feature projects I personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. I feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. At this point, I plan to try to continue making these posts until I have completed a full year. 

-If you decide to reply, please add something more than, ""scam"" or ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"". Please say why. If it is a scam, link or show evidence. If you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? It seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags. 


-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!

At first I did not like the Idea of paying a fee to create a Trust Line, in order to add assets in my wallet... I disliked the idea so much that I just deleted the wallet I wanted to play with (Lobstr wallet).🤣

Fast forward a year later... I see stuff from the Stellar Foundation on my Twitter feed, news they are getting cozy with the IMF... and I'm like, ok, I'll give it another go.

This time around I have a tiny stash of XLM, so I download Lobstr wallet and transfer those XLM in and create Trust Lines. Very fast and easy...

Next I go visit the Stellar site, and stellar port, and notice they look fresh, like they have been redone recently... also I see stellar has SSC - stellar smart contracts.

So what else is happening on the Stellar front? Tech wise it's fast and cheap, but why would you want to build on Stellar? What are the benefits?

I want to keep an open mind and I'm ready to give it a second look, and right now I'm at the stage where I'm thinking if I should get a big bag of XLM or not. At this price it's compelling.",32

a subject and dig into it as much as I can by reading technical articles,
books, and watching videos. I just got into a new job, and part of my role is
researching blockchain for the R&D department. 

The blockchain world is pretty new to me, and I found
the amount of information overwhelming. There's so much to know, so many
different companies, ideas, terminology, history (yes, for a newcomer, the
blockchain world seems like an old-world I'm telling you). Over the past three weeks,
I read tons of useful info online, some of it is useful for my company, and
some of it helped me understand blockchain better. I made a list of some of the
articles I found helpful. I found many more articles and resources, but here
are the ones I liked the most:

I am not sure which is the better card and which one should be preferred. 

The Fold card will start issuing their debit cards next week, starting with the first 1000 early access members of which I am a part of. It looks like they will be offering 1-2% Bitcoin (only) back on all purchases with their debit card. The good thing here is that it can go up to 2% and you get BTC back. The only downside here is, Fold is not a very well known company so I would be very hesitant to give them my SSN if they ask for it, which I think they most likely will. If someone can tell me why it's safe to give them my SSN, that would be really helpful. 

Coinbase hasn't indicated when their card will be out but Coinbase is a much bigger company and I have already shared my SSN with them. I was very comfortable sharing my SSN with Coinbase. Only thing here would be timing. I am not sure when their card would be out. The good thing with the CB card is that they seem to be offering 1% BTC or 4% Stellar XLM back on purchases. So I guess you can chose between both cards. 

Any thoughts on which card would be better and why? 

Also, if you haven't signed up with Fold yet, it is definitely worth a try. You can use this link to get 20,000 sats to get started.  [https://use.foldapp.com/r/Xd7ASMLe](https://use.foldapp.com/r/Xd7ASMLe)",8

Some colleagues in other cities make 5 times their salary only on bribery monthly, and it pretty much disgusts me.  

Obviously they only take cash, because otherwise it would raise suspicion from the ""IRS"" here with bank transfers and such. This results in many problems such for the non corrupt employees as having the same salary for 8 years now, even with a 50% inflation during this time.

We already have had tried to go on strike (I think that's what is called) without success because those people that take huge amounts of bribery, which are the biggest branches didn't join, so basically it was a mess and had no results.

You can't open any business without paying some money to whoever works in the City Hall that takes charge of the sector you're trying to enter, or building any construction without paying someone there as well. And this goes on on every level, for example there was a senator like a week ago that got caught up hiding cash in his underwear when federal police arrived, and it wasn't the first one to do so. I honestly think corruption is the biggest problem in third world countries.

Point is, Monero and other privacy coins facilitates this by a huge amount for obvious reasons, once someone took a bribery much more easily it can't be tracked anymore, and this is something that I think that needs to be addressed in such cases. Of course there is a huge positive side on having a privacy coin so you can spend your money without being constantly watched (to name one), but I think the downside in places such as where I live is more relevant.

What do you guys think about it?",51

I just don't know how it would impact it though. We could see a lot more people putting money into BTC because they don't trust the dollar will hold its value. Or we could see a lot less BTC being purchased because of the economy tanking and people spending their fiat on other things. I'm hoping in the end that their election goes rather smoothly, and violence is kept at a minimum, but with the way 2020 is acting it is hard for me to believe it will go that way.

They often think they're already too late and had missed the boat.

&#x200B;

[Did you miss Bitcoin?](https://i.redd.it/5dowxvm13rw51.gif)

But here are a couple of reasons, in my opinion, why buying Bitcoin right now is a no-brainer.

&#x200B;

**1. There are very few proven assets that offer the same promise of yield over the next decade or so.**

When you think about failing bank interest rates, the stock markets average 7-10 annual return for indexes, government bonds, and even gold; there are no assets that come close to Bitcoin in terms of annual yield in the long-term.

Over the past ten years, five years, and even this year amid the pandemic, Bitcoin has yielded investors' highest returns.

It's up around 70% YTD, and every-time Bitcoin drops 15-20%, it typically rebounds to recover way more than it lost.

**2. The 21 Million Limit Has Been Key**

Bitcoin's 21 million supply cap and the issuance schedule triggers the feeling of scarcity and why most people (including corporations are buying).

We are talking about the most scarce and valuable asset in the market right now, yet not many people get it.  

Publicly-traded companies [currently hold some 786,059 BTC](https://bitcointreasuries.org/), while large funds like Grayscale are still getting started, in my opinion, with around $5 billion in assets under management (AUM). Grayscale's Bitcoin fund will, at some point in the future, hold $100 billion in AUM, and we're just getting started.

Meanwhile, we're yet to talk about retail investors' supply being consumed on exchanges and apps like Cash App. 

Oh! and PayPal recently started selling Bitcoin too out of the 21 million cap.

The real scarcity is yet to kick in but is almost here.

**3. Regulation is Still Happening**

Many countries still prohibit citizens from buying Bitcoin or make it seem like a crime (India is a good example). As more countries begin to regulate, rather than frown at Bitcoin as an investment, one can only imagine the rate of new entrants to the market over the coming years.

Some users also have to deal with tax headaches when they pay or spend crypto, and any regulation that lifts that burden will be critical to mainstream usage of Bitcoin.

This has already become long, and I can still go-ahead to mention several other reasons why buying Bitcoin is a no-brainer.

For instance, we're yet to see a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S ([that will happen at some point](https://coinfomania.com/sec-chairman-says-were-closer-to-bitcoin-etf/)), and the number of Bitcoin ATMs globally is still just above 10,000.

The room for growth is immeasurable, and there's little reason to doubt that people buying Bitcoin now are making a mistake.

I won't bet that Bitcoin would be worth less in five years than it is now. If you're not willing to place such a bet, then like I mentioned at the onset, **buying Bitcoin is a No Brainer.**

I'm not going to make any future price prediction...

All of it often during  school or work time, eating away your attention and driving up your stress levels.  

# What to do to calm down, get more focused and charge your batteries again? 

**Activities:**

There are obvious things to do that help pretty immediately:

* sports (indoor, outdoor),
* taking walks, letting fresh air into your lungs (without your phone),
* occupy yourself with completely else to clear your mind for some time (manual things like cooking, cleaning)

**Habits:**

* don't let your phone be the first and last thing you hold in your hands during the day
* there are certain apps that track your phone time - you even can set limits to the use of certain apps 
* grant yourself some scheduled time when you can stare into the charts and check prices
* or estimate a certain day a week when you stay of completely

# Becoming more conscious and live the moment through meditation

This needs more time to achieve because there are some interesting **authors** and **books** involved to study. I for example think that **Eckhard Tolle** is a very inspiring person. One book that he is well known for and that I recommend is:

*  ***The Power of Now***: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment 

It is a book about being freed from compulsive thinking and also from ""*the prison of your mind*"" by becoming enlightended and more consious by living in the moment. 

Another author that I recommend - he gives very practical tipps how to meditate - is **Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche**, a Buddhist teacher. 

* ***The Joy of Living:*** Unlocking the Secret and Science of Happiness 

Hopefully you'll find some piece of thoughts to take away - to slow down, get more conscious and thus more relaxed and happy - let me end this with a quote from **Lao Tzu** (chinese philosopher):

*If you are depressed, you are living in the past.*

*If you are anxious, you are living in the future.*

*If you are at peace, you are living in the present.*",4

Moons were trading around 0.004 at the time and I figured $40 for a pizza may be a bit high but was within reason, especially as these tokens didn't cost me anything and I'd heard that selling them on the exchange was complicated anyway. I figured it would be a bit of good fun, people in the sub would be up for it just for shits and giggles, and it would be nice to be a part of the first ever Moon transaction (outside of the Reddit special membership) while at the same time paying homage to the Bitcoin pizza guy.

I made a draft of the post on my phone with the plan to post it after the next Moon distribution. It was only after concerns about privacy that I decided against it. Obviously I didn't want to give my home address to anyone, so I considered perhaps arranging the pickup in a public place like outside a supermarket, but then I thought perhaps even that is giving more private information about myself than I'd feel comfortable with sharing.

I was also put off by the thought of having my inbox full of people trying to scam me for those 10k Moons with no intention of delivering the pizza (obviously there would have needed to be an element of trust involved, and I'd only have sent the Moons after the pizza had been delivered).

As we all know, the price of Moons shot up quite a bit since then. Currently those 10k moons would be worth $500, and as much as I like pizza that's a bit more than I'd like to spend on the cheesy treat. I exchanged a few Moons for BTC when the price was around $0.18 and I was thinking at the time how relieved I was that I didn't make that 10k pizza post as the pizza would have been worth $1800 that day. Who knows what they could end up being worth? Obviously that would have been kind of the whole point of the original post. On the draft I wrote: *'I hope I don't regret this one day and become the new Bitcoin pizza guy!'* and although I'm glad I didn't go through with it in the end, there's still a part of me which thinks it would have been worth it, just for the potential memes if nothing else!

Anyway, I know it's a bit of a non-story because I didn't do it. But this little anecdote brings me to my **question:**

As privacy and the risk of potentially being scammed were the reasons that put me off doing this, I'd like to know: If someone ever wanted to make a Moon transaction with another Reddit user (whether for physical goods or for another cryptocurrency) what would be the best way to go about it? Because it would be great if we could use Moons as an actual currency with one another, but I don't see how it can be done without a large element of trust being involved. Is there anyway around this? Interested to hear your thoughts on this.",24

Usually I wouldn't complain about this, but Bitcoin.com is in the top few search results for ""buy bitcoin"", so I feel like it needs to be said.

Essentially what they're doing is a typical bait and switch. Bitcoin.com presents one price to lure you in, and then changes it at the last second, after you complete KYC verification.

[Here's an example.](https://i.imgur.com/rH3GNLa.png)

1000 USD is presented to purchase 0.08477 (this was taken last week).

That is market rate, so no problem. Let's buy it. 

I complete KYC, make an account, and I'm excited to buy Bitcoin at a fair price. But, then the switch happens.

[See here](https://i.imgur.com/bjqreEy.png). 

The deal went from $1000 = 0.08477 BTC, to $1000 = 0.08109 BTC. In this timeframe, there was no price swing to account for the change.

In addition, they're charging a further $75 processing fee. 

I can live with processing fees, but the Bitcoin price bait and switch is seriously not on, IMO.

What they've done in this example, is presented an offer of an initial Bitcoin price set at $11,797, and then changed the effective price to $12,332, before they add a further $75 fee. 

An almost $500 extra, hidden fee is seriously not OK, and should be pointed out. We really don't want new users (or seasoned ones) to have this experience as one of their first in the Bitcoin space.

Needless to say, I went back to Kraken.",74

I think the amount of USD is a constant and as the BTC has higher price, it drops. It is the only explanation.

Because of that this last month (October) the amount is low, 1,800 BTC (usually steady at 2,000 BTC).

Only measured by LocalBitcoin (For sure the biggest exchange here).

There’s been a lot of email & general phishing scams going around the cryptospace. I think, given the imminent influx of crypto newbies, we should try and educate everyone to the best on scam prevention and overall awareness.

If you own a Ledger, ([https://www.ledger.com/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/%22)), a lot of these scams are directly targeted to you. Recently, the huge information leak / hack on Ledger created a massive influx of fake emails & SMS messages to individuals who were on ledger’s purchase history.

These emails can be very convincing, often professionally done to mimic exactly what a legitimate ledger email would say. The link below shows a scam variation

[https://imgur.com/a/8VQuldc](https://imgur.com/a/8VQuldc)

They will most likely say something along the lines of believing your device is faulty or your coins are at risk of being stolen. They encourage you to click a link disguised as a helpful button. These links can lead you to another website where you could be asked to input your 24 word key phrase or even just outright compromise your ledger with malware. The safest practice with these emails or SMS messages is that you DO NOT CLICK ANY LINKS.

That may seem obvious to a lot of people, but if you have a decent sum of money on your ledger and you hear even that faintest idea that your coins could be jeopardized you can race to do impulsive actions – ie, clicking a phishing link.

This brings me to the most important part of avoiding phishing crypto scams.

**NEVER, EVER** **enter your 24-word recovery phrase anywhere else other than on your physical ledger device.**

Furthermore, I advocate downloading the metamask chrome extension ([https://metamask.io/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/%22))

It has a built in feature which helps prevent phishing attempts on malicious websites or links. If you were to stumble onto one such instance with metamask installed you would get this :

If Bitcoin is Yin, altcoins are Yang. The problem for altcoins is that the market hasn't picked one to be Yang, they pick all of them all at once. Altcoins are suffering from being too plentiful...an ever increasing amount of altcoins are ever inflating are fighting for the same slice of the pie of altcoin pie. They are all weighing each other down. One could argue the market doesn't need just one altcoin. Pretty much every coin in the top 15 has a unique structure, team, and purpose. I think many assume that every ""altcoin"" just wants to replace the dollar because BTC does, when in fact many of these coins never tried to be an all purpose currency, and in fact have much more nuanced value propositions. What is clear to me is that Bitcoin remains the unchallenged king, despite having thousands of coins competing.

*Ethereum*, the largest altcoin, has many problems growing going forward. You have to remember why billionaires and millionaires are buying bitcoin and giving bitcoin a high valuation in the first place: wealth preservation and USD/fiat hedge. They aren't buying it to get rich, because well, they are already rich in the first place. In contrast, the entire appeal of Ethereum is going from rags to riches in the altcoin casino, and casinos generally appeal to people who aren't rich. Not to mention Ethereum isn't a technical currency, doesn't have a supply cap and is far more centralized so it doesn't act as a fundamental hedge against fiat. You have to remember ETH is a platform where users are more attached to the content hosted on the service rather than the service itself, and risks becoming ""myspaced"" if another service becomes more attractive. ETH will risk getting left behind if it doesn't update itself in 3.0, 4.0, 10.0, 100.0, etc... but also risks becoming too centralized and aliening it's userbase if it changes too much.

*Defi* has even more problems. Most of them are inflationary by design and most investors are oblivious to the actual monetary policies within the coins. Defi operates in a legal grey area among most of the world, and if they aren't already illegal in many countries already under existing law, they will be illegal soon in most of the world for facilitating unlicensed/unregistered borrowing and lending, and money laundering. There is a reason why these services require things like KYC in real life, because smart contracts aren't actual legal contracts. If software  code were passable as contracts, you would not be required to sign a Terms of Service contract on every website you browse.

&#x200B;

*Stablecoins* look to be taking over the altcoin market silently, and USDT is on pace to overtake Ethereum by next year. Stablecoins have the biggest potential to become bitcoin's Yang, but it will probably be in the form of an official stable coin released by the US Federal Reserve. I think USD vs Gold will turn into Digital USD vs Digital Gold.",4

-Since 2/18/20, every day I have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. I try to make follow up posts within a week, but I am behind at the moment. I try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. Sometimes I even feature projects I personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. I feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. At this point, I plan to try to continue making these posts until I have completed a full year. 

-If you decide to reply, please add something more than, ""scam"" or ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"". Please say why. If it is a scam, link or show evidence. If you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? It seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags. 


-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!
