# Preface {-}

This project is an exploration of language in the comments from the two most popular subreddits oriented towards the discussion of Crypto-currencies and the trading of block-chain assets. The methodologies used herein include tokenization, sentiment analysis using dictionaries, and associative visualization primarily using packages found within the tidyverse.
